I do love the \"those who question Moroccan sovereignty are imprisoned\". I mean that's kinda how it works in every country, either you respect their laws or go to jail? I understand the unspoken refutation of Morocco's rule in the area butttttttttt probably not gonna work. No one is on ISIS's side, the Berber tribes are fractured in the area (apart from the IS-leaning ones), and the don't seem to be able to win. Eventually I imagine that there will be an ISIS attack or something and Morocco finally feels ready enough to restart the war between the two and take most or all of the remaining territory of Western Sahara east of the Great Berm.",

It misses out that Morocco was significantly amputated by colonisation in the 19th century and Spain took the territory from Morocco at the end of the 19th century. Therefore, Morocco who had already lost the territory of Mauritania and Eastern Sahara (Western Algeria - Tindouf, Béchard, Adrar and Tidikelt) was not going to let this one go! \n\n2. The area on the other side of the wall is not controlled by the Polisario. Rather, it’s a forbidden to people demilitarised buffer zone! Many Polisario incursions over the last few years have been met with Moroccan drones!",

I think you have orders from Israel.

Is it the refugees in tindouf , whose exact number are unknown and any attempt to number them are stoped by Algeria and the Polisario. Or is it the population in Morocco (the part controlled by Morocco ), to which the Polisario will refuse as they see it’s not fair. So what now ? Give us a solution to this. Oh I know, since a referendum is practically impossible, the UN should look for other alternatives, and for the past 20 years the Moroccan autonomy plan was the only solution that’s realistic and what happened now with this resolution is just the UN finally adopting it as a basis of future discussions. Effectively marking an end to any talks about a referendum",

In September 1991, the UN brokered a ceasefire and a simple deal: the 16 year old war would end, and within a year, the UN would organize a referendum to let the Sahrawi peoples decide their future. To make this happen, the UN created a mission called MINURSO. As the voter registry was being made, Morocco flooded Western Sahara with Moroccan settlers and demanded that they be allowed to vote (which cleary would influence the referendum greatly to their favor). This directly violated the Geneva Conventions: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population into the territory it occupies”. For more than 30 years, this referendum was not held. There was another referendum in 2007 that was proposed by James Baker, former secretary of state of US, but again Morocco declined… I hope you understand what is going on.",

You spook about agression of the Sahrawi people yet only Algerian and Polisario n sympathizers media who speak of such agression. Now, the referendum idea is buried deep and will never resurface. The UN now will use the Moroccan autonomy plan to s the only basis of discussion. The Polisario now will either accept or be classified as s a terrorist organization (I didn’t mention their links with Iran Hezbollah, and Sahel terrorists, lol)",

This decision, however, was not based on any cultural or national differences, but rather on the country’s distance and the practical challenges of governance. Later, the Bedouins living in Western Sahara, encouraged by Algeria, began demanding the same independence that had been granted to Mauritania. When these demands turned violent, Morocco rejected the comparison, maintaining that the situation in Western Sahara was fundamentally different.",

This decision, however, was not based on any cultural or national differences, but rather on the country’s distance and the practical challenges of governance. Later, the Bedouins living in Western Sahara, encouraged by Algeria, began demanding the same independence that had been granted to Mauritania. When these demands turned violent, Morocco rejected the comparison, maintaining that the situation in Western Sahara was fundamentally different.",

Long story short, the senile so called generals cannot pull the gang out of the dialogue roundtable since this time the BIG EYE is closely watching over them, trust me! the old feral rates will be hammered the moment they think of misbehaving or missing around with the American led initiative. The time is set for the long overdue final episode where everything is pre-settled, pre-defined and pre-agreed upon in advance. NO ROOMS for last minute surprises, Moroccan brains finalized the work knowing where the communication will lead. Hence, nothing left to chance or coincidence. To lay it more blatantly: accept my designed autonomy plan or get doomed for real. The gang along with their master’s unwillingly embraced Option 1. Period.\r\n\r\nMedia and diplomacy will mince words to make it look like this is a consensual agreement. In light of this, Morocco was also urged not to add salt to injury spreading across the alergian corpse.",

The Turks know well the borders of their province Eyalet El Jazair.  Moroccans know well their borders and we will not allow Europe nor Algeria to dictate what they are.  The Sahara was Morocco since the 12th century during the reign of the Almoravid Royal family.  It was also Moroccan during the reign of Almohad, Merinids, Saadi dynasties.  And was Moroccan before the region was colonized by Spain in the 19th century during the Alaouites dynasty.  Europe stripped many Moroccan lands just like they did to Turkey after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.  We will not play European games here.  And we will certainly not allow a communist militia set up a communist republic in our lands.  If Europeans are bored, they can give independence to Catalunya, Basque Country, Corsica or Scotland.  Or Kabylia for Algeria!",

        "text": "​@wijdaxAlgeria, as a modern nation-state, was **not created by France**, but its current borders, administrative systems, and aspects of its political identity were heavily shaped by **French colonial rule (1830–1962)**. Here’s a breakdown:  <br><br>### <b>*1. Pre-Colonial Algeria*</b>  <br>- Before French colonization, Algeria was part of various North African empires (Numidians, Romans, Ottomans).  <br>- From 1516–1830, it was an <b>*Ottoman regency*</b> (autonomous province) with local rulers (*deys*).  <br><br>### <b>*2. French Colonization (1830–1962)*</b>  <br>- France invaded Algiers in **1830**, gradually conquering the territory.  <br>- By 1848, Algeria was declared <b>*French soil*</b> (not a colony but an integral part of France).  <br>- France imposed its administrative, educational, and economic systems, **dismantling traditional Algerian structures**.  <br><br>### <b>*3. Impact on Modern Algeria*</b>  <br>- <b>*Borders**: France defined Algeria’s modern borders, including the disputed **southern territories*</b> (later used for nuclear tests).  <br>- **Language &amp; Culture**: French became dominant; Arabic/Berber identity was suppressed.  <br>- **Political System**: Post-independence Algeria inherited France’s **centralized governance model**.  <br><br>### <b>*4. Independence (1962)*</b>  <br>- After a brutal <b>*8-year war*</b> (1954–1962), Algeria gained independence via the **Évian Accords**.  <br>- The **FLN (National Liberation Front)**, which led the revolution, established a socialist republic, **rejecting France’s legacy but retaining its administrative framework**.  <br><br>### <b>*5. Did France &quot;Create&quot; Algeria?*</b>  <br>- **No**: Algeria existed as a distinct region before France.  <br>- <b>*But**: Modern Algeria’s **state institutions, borders, and even some political elites*</b> (like the FLN) emerged in reaction to French rule.  <br><br>### <b>*Key Controversies*</b>  <br>- **Pieds-Noirs**: Over 1 million European settlers fled Algeria in 1962, leaving economic scars.  <br>- **Harkis**: Algerian collaborators with France were massacred post-independence.  <br>- **Neo-Colonialism**: France retained influence (oil/gas interests, military ties) until the 2020s.  <br><br>### <b>*Conclusion*</b>  <br>France didn’t &quot;create&quot; Algeria but **reshaped it violently**, leaving a legacy that still affects Algeria’s politics, language, and relations with Morocco (e.g., Western Sahara conflict).",

        "text": "​@wijdax and Algeria even fought a war with France for 8 years <br>The <b>*Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962)*</b> was not just important—it was a **watershed moment in modern history**, reshaping global politics, ending empires, and igniting debates about freedom, violence, and justice that still rage today. Here’s why it matters:<br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*1. It Destroyed France’s Illusion of Imperial Power*</b>  <br>- France had considered Algeria <b>*part of its homeland*</b> (unlike other colonies), making the war a <b>*civil war*</b> as much as a colonial conflict.  <br>- The conflict exposed France’s **systematic use of torture**, mass internment camps, and collective punishment, shocking the world and fracturing French society.  <br>- It led to the <b>*collapse of the French Fourth Republic*</b> (1958) and brought **de Gaulle to power**, who eventually accepted Algerian independence despite fierce opposition (including assassination attempts by far-right militias).  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*2. It Redefined What &quot;Decolonization&quot; Could Look Like*</b>  <br>- Unlike peaceful transitions in British Africa, Algeria’s war proved that **violence was often the price of freedom**—inspiring armed struggles from **Palestine to South Africa**.  <br>- The FLN’s tactics (urban guerrilla warfare, international diplomacy) became a **playbook for liberation movements**.  <br>- It forced the UN to confront colonialism head-on, making Algeria a **symbol of the Global South’s rise**.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*3. It Created Modern Algeria—For Better or Worse*</b>  <br>- The war <b>*killed 300,000–1 million Algerians*</b> (6–20% of the population) and left deep scars.  <br>- The FLN’s victory established a <b>*one-party socialist state*</b> that still dominates Algeria today, stifling dissent under the banner of &quot;revolutionary legitimacy.&quot;  <br>- **Post-war Algeria became a Cold War battleground**, aligning with the USSR and hosting revolutionaries like Che Guevara.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*4. It Haunts France to This Day*</b>  <br>- The war split France: **Leftists supported Algerian independence**, while far-right militants (OAS) bombed Paris to stop it.  <br>- Over <b>*1 million French settlers (Pieds-Noirs)*</b> fled to France, forming a **vocal anti-Algerian lobby**.  <br>- France only admitted it was a &quot;war&quot; (not a &quot;police operation&quot;) in **1999**—and still refuses to fully apologize for torture or massacres.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*5. It Shapes the Maghreb’s Geopolitics*</b>  <br>- Algeria’s support for the <b>*Polisario Front*</b> in Western Sahara is rooted in its own anti-colonial struggle—a direct challenge to Morocco.  <br>- The war poisoned <b>*Franco-Algerian relations*</b> for decades (e.g., visa disputes, gas deals, memory wars).  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*Why It Still Matters*</b>  <br>- **Colonial Apologies**: Macron has taken steps (admitting torture, opening archives), but Algeria demands reparations.  <br>- **Immigrant Identity**: France’s Algerian diaspora (the largest in Europe) grapples with **generational trauma**.  <br>- **Authoritarianism**: Algeria’s regime still uses the war to **silence critics**, claiming dissent &quot;betrays the martyrs.&quot;  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*Final Thought*</b>  <br>This wasn’t just a war—it was a **reckoning**. It proved empires could bleed to death, that liberation could come at a moral cost, and that the wounds of history never fully heal.",

        "text": "​@wijdaxNo, Morocco did <b>*not*</b> effectively occupy or administer Western Sahara before Spain&#39;s colonization in **1884**. Here’s the historical breakdown:<br><br>### <b>*1. Pre-Spanish Period (Before 1884)*</b><br>- Western Sahara was a <b>*sparsely populated desert region*</b> inhabited by <b>*nomadic Sahrawi tribes*</b> (such as the Reguibat, Oulad Delim, and Tekna).<br>- These tribes had **loose, shifting allegiances**—sometimes paying tribute to the Moroccan Sultan (based in cities like Marrakesh or Fez) or Mauritanian emirates, but often acting independently.<br>- <b>*No permanent Moroccan administration*</b> (taxation, courts, or military garrisons) existed in Western Sahara.<br><br>### <b>*2. Morocco’s Historical Claims*</b><br>- Morocco argues that some Sahrawi tribes <b>*pledged allegiance (bay&#39;ah)*</b> to Moroccan sultans in the 17th–19th centuries.<br>- However, these oaths were **symbolic and intermittent**, not proof of direct control. The Sahara remained **de facto autonomous**.<br><br>### <b>*3. Spain’s Colonization (1884)*</b><br>- At the **Berlin Conference (1884–85)**, Spain claimed Western Sahara as **&quot;Spanish Sahara&quot;**, with no Moroccan resistance.<br>- Morocco itself was <b>*weak and fragmented*</b> in the 19th century, struggling against European encroachment (France occupied Morocco in **1912**).<br><br>### <b>*4. International Court of Justice (ICJ) Ruling (1975)*</b><br>- The ICJ examined Morocco’s historical claims and <b>*rejected*</b> the argument of pre-colonial sovereignty:<br>  &gt; <b>&quot;The Court’s conclusion is that the materials and information presented to it do not establish any tie of territorial sovereignty between Western Sahara and the Moroccan Sultanate.&quot;</b>  <br>- Instead, the ICJ affirmed the **right of Sahrawis to self-determination**.<br><br>### <b>*5. Post-1975: Moroccan Occupation*</b><br>- After Spain withdrew, Morocco <b>*militarily occupied*</b> Western Sahara (via the **Green March**), despite the ICJ ruling.<br>- Today, Morocco controls ~80% of the territory, but the **UN still classifies it as a non-self-governing colony**.<br><br>### <b>*Conclusion*</b>  <br>Morocco had <b>*no sustained political or military control*</b> over Western Sahara before Spain. Its current claim relies on <b>*post-1975 occupation**, not pre-colonial rule. The **Polisario Front*</b> and international law still demand a **self-determination referendum**.",

        "text": "Truth is that Moroccans are expansionists, they attacked Algeria right after its independence in 1962. And just like Israel, they have a project called “the Grand Morocco”, they intend to extend the territory France helped them enlarge, up to mid Algeria, and are very vocal about it. \nWester Sahara is very rich in phosphate (that is critical for agriculture and will be lacking in a couple of years). So the deal was: you help us colonizing this country, and you get an endless supply (similar to the Quincy agreement between USA and Saudi Arabia).\nThe European Court found illegal the commerce of Wstern Sahara’s resources on behalf of Morocco to the EU, but guess what: they can’t care less as they are protected by the west. \n\nMost of the people don’t know about this because the US, France, Israel… (govt, not people) are complicit, and therefore the UN can’t do anything about it. \n\nIndeed.m, Algeria pressured the Security Council lately to resolve this issue. But America and France proposed a resolution to postpone it, instead (for more background look for : Security Council Resolution to extend MINURSO’s mandate for another year).\n\n*A fact to consider, for people in the comments struggling with some Moroccans: they are propagandized, and that in addition to the fact that 49% of Moroccans suffer from mental illness (according to a recent report easily found on internet), they were also found to be the most dishonest people in the world by to 2 British studies (one in 2016 and one in 2019).\n\nTo Moroccans: stop saying “We didn’t know😢”. It’s the first thing that comes out of your mouth whenever you meet with an Algerian as Algeria is on the side of Wester Sahara.\n\nFree Wester Sahara 🇪🇭",

Literally from the conception of the colony, Western Sahara has been something separate from Morocco. Spain never divided Morocco and the Sahara, because from the beginning the Sahara did not belong to Morocco. If the Sahara had belonged to Morocco, it would have been decolonized together with the Spanish protectorate of Morocco in 1956.",

        "text": "Morocco's inconsistencies in claiming Western Sahara are very curious and funny:\n\n1) By the 1830s, the decade of colonization, the Sultanate of Morocco did not have the territories of the Sahara. It did have them at its peak, but by the time Spain colonized the Sahara there was the Tekna confederation, which did not depend politically or religiously on Morocco.\n\n2) It tries to feed back to the Almoravid and Almohad empires that came to have control over the Sahara, but these empires ended 800 years ago. That's a long time. Literally more time has passed since the fall of the Almohad empire than the entire history of Al-Andalus.\n\n3) The \"Greater Morocco\" plan brings together all the territories that once belonged to those medieval dynasties as Moroccan territory. Does it remind you of anyone? (cough...cough...Israel...cough cough...)\n\n4) Many Moroccans support the Palestinian cause, but the Moroccan government is pro-Israel. Isn't there a contradiction? It's literally the same phenomenon. A country claims a territory that belonged to it hundreds of years ago but at that time it didn't, and invades it without considering what the people there think.\n\n5) Morocco in general of the Amazigh peoples who live there. Curiously, the Tekna Sahrawis are also an Amazigh people. Why did they have to exile themselves to Tindouf? Aren't they part of their own people?\n\n6) If Morocco is truly the legitimate sovereign of the Sahara, why has it systematically refused to hold a referendum? Are they afraid of losing? Aren't the Sahrawis supposed to be part of their people, so why would they vote against Morocco?\n\nObviously all this happens because Morocco is based on an expansionist delusion with historical distortion. And even if we agreed with it, what is the point of invading a territory and starting a war with your supposedly own people? Expansionist delusions. There is no other explanation.\n\nSupport for Western Sahara!",

If we (Morocco) do so Morocco wil be Powerful and it can then reclaim all its territory under Spanish occuppation only by strenght and Force and backed by Russian weaponry and with Russian Power Morocco can infleunce the whole region and nobody in europe will dare to dream to colonize North Africa ever again. Its time to wake up America will never come to the needs of Morocco. The americans only sell us weapons and have never done something Good for morocco.

In switzerland you have to have a important reason to drive at 00:00 or later. In Morocco you can drive Bicycle. In Switzerland you have to do a Driving Test for everyrhing. In Morocco you can wear whatever you want. In switzerland you cant wear niqab. In Morocco you can work without any without an apprenticeship. In switzerland you need apprenticeship to work. In Morocco you can drive every Car. In Switzerland certain cars arenot allowed.... Just some examples but there are more and more...\nThe Moroccan Gov offered the Polisario so many time to turn back to Morocco and they can get the Citizenship but they denied it. 90% of the Polisarios are not even Saharawis. They are Traitors originally from Marrakech, Rabat, Ouarzazate and other Moroccan Cities. Even though they kidnapped so many innocent moroccans to bring them to Tindouf the Moroccan gov always offered them a peaceful solution. So stop accusing Morocco of something the Algerian Media has made fake news of.",

These are the 3 options that exist for this conflict!<br><br>What do you think? Would the sahrawis be happy enough with big autonomy where they can manage their own educational, healthcare, and budget systems with equal rights and the regonition of Hassaniya arabic, or is independence the only way?<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to hear your answer 🤔, and also when you give the answer, please give me the reason or pusher behind it 👍",

        "text": "Great video, thanks for making something on such a forgotten conflict. I’ve been personally involved with the Sahrawi (fyi it’s pronounced sah-rawi) community living in the refugee camps in Algeria since 2012, teaching and facilitating training programs in Smara, Layounne and Boujdour each year. The situation on the camps is not improving, 50 years on people still live on emergency food rations, water is bought in each day by tankers and malnutrition is widespread. The more the international community look away the worse the situation is for those in the camps and those living under the brutal Moroccan occupation. Let’s stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the Sahrawi people, they are brave, gracious, generous, resilient and compassionate despite years of persecution by Morocco and neglect by the international community.",

The Spanish colonisers were forced out through the famous GREEN MARCH, where over 350000 Moroccans walked into the region in a peaceful protest that forced the Spaniards out. Please do a better research b4 u go on spreading misinformation. If u try and argue the point, I will say this to u, Morocco's and has been enjoying everything that region has to offer since then (u wouldn't know ANYTHING about ALBAYA (allegiance).The sahrawi people had forever been under Albaya to the Moroccan sultans. There was never any polizario. They're a bunch of low lives bought and paid for by Algeria that is still paying for them until today (with my best wishes). That country who's always had a complex regarding the long and rich history of it's neighbours, unlike them who have never got out from their colonial past. 450 years of ottoman rule, then they sold it to France for another 130 years.",

        "text": "Morocco's inconsistencies in claiming Western Sahara are very curious and funny:\n\n1) By the 1830s, the decade of colonization, the Sultanate of Morocco did not have the territories of the Sahara. It did have them at its peak, but by the time Spain colonized the Sahara there was the Tekna confederation, which did not depend politically or religiously on Morocco.\n\n2) It tries to feed back to the Almoravid and Almohad empires that came to have control over the Sahara, but these empires ended 800 years ago. That's a long time. Literally more time has passed since the fall of the Almohad empire than the entire history of Al-Andalus.\n\n3) The \"Greater Morocco\" plan brings together all the territories that once belonged to those medieval dynasties as Moroccan territory. Does it remind you of anyone? (cough...cough...Israel...cough cough...)\n\n4) Many Moroccans support the Palestinian cause, but the Moroccan government is pro-Israel. Isn't there a contradiction? It's literally the same phenomenon. A country claims a territory that belonged to it hundreds of years ago but at that time it didn't, and invades it without considering what the people there think.\n\n5) Morocco in general of the Amazigh peoples who live there. Curiously, the Tekna Sahrawis are also an Amazigh people. Why did they have to exile themselves to Tindouf? Aren't they part of their own people?\n\n6) If Morocco is truly the legitimate sovereign of the Sahara, why has it systematically refused to hold a referendum? Are they afraid of losing? Aren't the Sahrawis supposed to be part of their people, so why would they vote against Morocco?\n\nObviously all this happens because Morocco is based on an expansionist delusion with historical distortion. And even if we agreed with it, what is the point of invading a territory and starting a war with your supposedly own people? Expansionist delusions. There is no other explanation.\n\nSupport for Western Sahara!",

They then spent most of their time trying to unite the country, because it was before then fragmented, with warlord chiefs fighting each other. Even the Alawi themselves fought each other, as is the case when Moulay Ismail died and his sons started to fight one another and established their own &quot;little kingdom&quot;. It was Sidi Mohammed bin Abdullah who regained control again. In 1912, the french save the kingdom from collapse, when Sultan Abduhafid was demounted after a popular rebellion against him. The french then declared the kingdom as a protectorate (an occupation in desguise), and appointed Youssaf (the brother of Abdulhafid) as Sutan. It was the french who designed the current Moroccan flag and it was a french who composed the music of the new national hymn.",

That’s the way innit? Then, why doesn’t the UN do that… i think we know\n\nWho carried out constant aggression towards the Sahrawi people? It was Morocco before 21st century. In September 1991, the UN brokered a ceasefire and a simple deal: the 16 year old war would end, and within a year, the UN would organize a referendum to let the Sahrawi peoples decide their future. To make this happen, the UN created a mission called MINURSO. As the voter registry was being made, Morocco flooded Western Sahara with Moroccan settlers and demanded that they be allowed to vote (which cleary would influence the referendum greatly to their favor). This directly violated the Geneva Conventions: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population into the territory it occupies”. For more than 30 years, this referendum was not held. There was another referendum in 2007 that was proposed by James Baker, former secretary of state of US, but again Morocco declined… I hope you understand what is going on.",

This decision, however, was not based on any cultural or national differences, but rather on the country’s distance and the practical challenges of governance. Later, the Bedouins living in Western Sahara, encouraged by Algeria, began demanding the same independence that had been granted to Mauritania. When these demands turned violent, Morocco rejected the comparison, maintaining that the situation in Western Sahara was fundamentally different.",

Also if you really agreed on partition of lands after independent war Algeria why did u steal those lands ? Give them back . It sounds like 12 island of agean which italy stole from us and give them to greece . Also two cities of Iraq which Britain promised for self determination voting which never happened . Now many years passed we dont want war with Iraq because our enemy was Britain . Also about Islands our enemy was Italy too but they give them to our another enemy . This makes our claims more tensed and alive. Yet we dont want a war with our neighbors. I think your enemies are at other side of the sea too . \n\nFrom view of Republican : Dude give the lands to opressed local people because they want to break free.",

I understand the unspoken refutation of Morocco's rule in the area butttttttttt probably not gonna work. No one is on ISIS's side, the Berber tribes are fractured in the area (apart from the IS-leaning ones), and the don't seem to be able to win. Eventually I imagine that there will be an ISIS attack or something and Morocco finally feels ready enough to restart the war between the two and take most or all of the remaining territory of Western Sahara east of the Great Berm.",

It misses out that Morocco was significantly amputated by colonisation in the 19th century and Spain took the territory from Morocco at the end of the 19th century. Therefore, Morocco who had already lost the territory of Mauritania and Eastern Sahara (Western Algeria - Tindouf, Béchard, Adrar and Tidikelt) was not going to let this one go! \n\n2. The area on the other side of the wall is not controlled by the Polisario. Rather, it’s a forbidden to people demilitarised buffer zone!

Even the Alawi themselves fought each other, as is the case when Moulay Ismail died and his sons started to fight one another and established their own &quot;little kingdom&quot;. It was Sidi Mohammed bin Abdullah who regained control again. In 1912, the french save the kingdom from collapse, when Sultan Abduhafid was demounted after a popular rebellion against him. The french then declared the kingdom as a protectorate (an occupation in desguise), and appointed Youssaf (the brother of Abdulhafid) as Sutan. It was the french who designed the current Moroccan flag and it was a french who composed the music of the new national hymn.",

        "text": "The solution on paper is fairly simple: A free and open refendum supervised by the UN where the Western Sahara’s indigenous people, the Sahrawis, vote to either choose independence or integrate into Morocco. That’s the way innit? Then, why doesn’t the UN do that… i think we know\n\nWho carried out constant aggression towards the Sahrawi people? It was Morocco before 21st century. In September 1991, the UN brokered a ceasefire and a simple deal: the 16 year old war would end, and within a year, the UN would organize a referendum to let the Sahrawi peoples decide their future. To make this happen, the UN created a mission called MINURSO. As the voter registry was being made, Morocco flooded Western Sahara with Moroccan settlers and demanded that they be allowed to vote (which cleary would influence the referendum greatly to their favor). This directly violated the Geneva Conventions: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population into the territory it occupies”. For more than 30 years, this referendum was not held. There was another referendum in 2007 that was proposed by James Baker, former secretary of state of US, but again Morocco declined… I hope you understand what is going on.",

Later, the Bedouins living in Western Sahara, encouraged by Algeria, began demanding the same independence that had been granted to Mauritania. When these demands turned violent, Morocco rejected the comparison, maintaining that the situation in Western Sahara was fundamentally different.",

Now many years passed we dont want war with Iraq because our enemy was Britain . Also about Islands our enemy was Italy too but they give them to our another enemy . This makes our claims more tensed and alive. Yet we dont want a war with our neighbors.

        "text": "Truth is that Moroccans are expansionists, they attacked Algeria right after its independence in 1962. And just like Israel, they have a project called “the Grand Morocco”, they intend to extend the territory France helped them enlarge, up to mid Algeria, and are very vocal about it. \nWester Sahara is very rich in phosphate (that is critical for agriculture and will be lacking in a couple of years). So the deal was: you help us colonizing this country, and you get an endless supply (similar to the Quincy agreement between USA and Saudi Arabia).\nThe European Court found illegal the commerce of Wstern Sahara’s resources on behalf of Morocco to the EU, but guess what: they can’t care less as they are protected by the west. \n\nMost of the people don’t know about this because the US, France, Israel… (govt, not people) are complicit, and therefore the UN can’t do anything about it. \n\nIndeed.m, Algeria pressured the Security Council lately to resolve this issue. But America and France proposed a resolution to postpone it, instead (for more background look for : Security Council Resolution to extend MINURSO’s mandate for another year).\n\n*A fact to consider, for people in the comments struggling with some Moroccans: they are propagandized, and that in addition to the fact that 49% of Moroccans suffer from mental illness (according to a recent report easily found on internet), they were also found to be the most dishonest people in the world by to 2 British studies (one in 2016 and one in 2019).\n\nTo Moroccans: stop saying “We didn’t know😢”. It’s the first thing that comes out of your mouth whenever you meet with an Algerian as Algeria is on the side of Wester Sahara.\n\nFree Wester Sahara 🇪🇭",

Literally from the conception of the colony, Western Sahara has been something separate from Morocco. Spain never divided Morocco and the Sahara, because from the beginning the Sahara did not belong to Morocco. If the Sahara had belonged to Morocco, it would have been decolonized together with the Spanish protectorate of Morocco in 1956.",

        "text": "Morocco's inconsistencies in claiming Western Sahara are very curious and funny:\n\n1) By the 1830s, the decade of colonization, the Sultanate of Morocco did not have the territories of the Sahara. It did have them at its peak, but by the time Spain colonized the Sahara there was the Tekna confederation, which did not depend politically or religiously on Morocco.\n\n2) It tries to feed back to the Almoravid and Almohad empires that came to have control over the Sahara, but these empires ended 800 years ago. That's a long time. Literally more time has passed since the fall of the Almohad empire than the entire history of Al-Andalus.\n\n3) The \"Greater Morocco\" plan brings together all the territories that once belonged to those medieval dynasties as Moroccan territory. Does it remind you of anyone? (cough...cough...Israel...cough cough...)\n\n4) Many Moroccans support the Palestinian cause, but the Moroccan government is pro-Israel. Isn't there a contradiction? It's literally the same phenomenon. A country claims a territory that belonged to it hundreds of years ago but at that time it didn't, and invades it without considering what the people there think.\n\n5) Morocco in general of the Amazigh peoples who live there. Curiously, the Tekna Sahrawis are also an Amazigh people. Why did they have to exile themselves to Tindouf? Aren't they part of their own people?\n\n6) If Morocco is truly the legitimate sovereign of the Sahara, why has it systematically refused to hold a referendum? Are they afraid of losing? Aren't the Sahrawis supposed to be part of their people, so why would they vote against Morocco?\n\nObviously all this happens because Morocco is based on an expansionist delusion with historical distortion. And even if we agreed with it, what is the point of invading a territory and starting a war with your supposedly own people? Expansionist delusions. There is no other explanation.\n\nSupport for Western Sahara!",

        "text": "​@wijdaxAlgeria, as a modern nation-state, was **not created by France**, but its current borders, administrative systems, and aspects of its political identity were heavily shaped by **French colonial rule (1830–1962)**. Here’s a breakdown:  <br><br>### <b>*1. Pre-Colonial Algeria*</b>  <br>- Before French colonization, Algeria was part of various North African empires (Numidians, Romans, Ottomans).  <br>- From 1516–1830, it was an <b>*Ottoman regency*</b> (autonomous province) with local rulers (*deys*).  <br><br>### <b>*2. French Colonization (1830–1962)*</b>  <br>- France invaded Algiers in **1830**, gradually conquering the territory.  <br>- By 1848, Algeria was declared <b>*French soil*</b> (not a colony but an integral part of France).  <br>- France imposed its administrative, educational, and economic systems, **dismantling traditional Algerian structures**.  <br><br>### <b>*3. Impact on Modern Algeria*</b>  <br>- <b>*Borders**: France defined Algeria’s modern borders, including the disputed **southern territories*</b> (later used for nuclear tests).  <br>- **Language &amp; Culture**: French became dominant; Arabic/Berber identity was suppressed.  <br>- **Political System**: Post-independence Algeria inherited France’s **centralized governance model**.  <br><br>### <b>*4. Independence (1962)*</b>  <br>- After a brutal <b>*8-year war*</b> (1954–1962), Algeria gained independence via the **Évian Accords**.  <br>- The **FLN (National Liberation Front)**, which led the revolution, established a socialist republic, **rejecting France’s legacy but retaining its administrative framework**.  <br><br>### <b>*5. Did France &quot;Create&quot; Algeria?*</b>  <br>- **No**: Algeria existed as a distinct region before France.  <br>- <b>*But**: Modern Algeria’s **state institutions, borders, and even some political elites*</b> (like the FLN) emerged in reaction to French rule.  <br><br>### <b>*Key Controversies*</b>  <br>- **Pieds-Noirs**: Over 1 million European settlers fled Algeria in 1962, leaving economic scars.  <br>- **Harkis**: Algerian collaborators with France were massacred post-independence.  <br>- **Neo-Colonialism**: France retained influence (oil/gas interests, military ties) until the 2020s.  <br><br>### <b>*Conclusion*</b>  <br>France didn’t &quot;create&quot; Algeria but **reshaped it violently**, leaving a legacy that still affects Algeria’s politics, language, and relations with Morocco (e.g., Western Sahara conflict).",

        "text": "​@wijdax and Algeria even fought a war with France for 8 years <br>The <b>*Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962)*</b> was not just important—it was a **watershed moment in modern history**, reshaping global politics, ending empires, and igniting debates about freedom, violence, and justice that still rage today. Here’s why it matters:<br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*1. It Destroyed France’s Illusion of Imperial Power*</b>  <br>- France had considered Algeria <b>*part of its homeland*</b> (unlike other colonies), making the war a <b>*civil war*</b> as much as a colonial conflict.  <br>- The conflict exposed France’s **systematic use of torture**, mass internment camps, and collective punishment, shocking the world and fracturing French society.  <br>- It led to the <b>*collapse of the French Fourth Republic*</b> (1958) and brought **de Gaulle to power**, who eventually accepted Algerian independence despite fierce opposition (including assassination attempts by far-right militias).  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*2. It Redefined What &quot;Decolonization&quot; Could Look Like*</b>  <br>- Unlike peaceful transitions in British Africa, Algeria’s war proved that **violence was often the price of freedom**—inspiring armed struggles from **Palestine to South Africa**.  <br>- The FLN’s tactics (urban guerrilla warfare, international diplomacy) became a **playbook for liberation movements**.  <br>- It forced the UN to confront colonialism head-on, making Algeria a **symbol of the Global South’s rise**.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*3. It Created Modern Algeria—For Better or Worse*</b>  <br>- The war <b>*killed 300,000–1 million Algerians*</b> (6–20% of the population) and left deep scars.  <br>- The FLN’s victory established a <b>*one-party socialist state*</b> that still dominates Algeria today, stifling dissent under the banner of &quot;revolutionary legitimacy.&quot;  <br>- **Post-war Algeria became a Cold War battleground**, aligning with the USSR and hosting revolutionaries like Che Guevara.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*4. It Haunts France to This Day*</b>  <br>- The war split France: **Leftists supported Algerian independence**, while far-right militants (OAS) bombed Paris to stop it.  <br>- Over <b>*1 million French settlers (Pieds-Noirs)*</b> fled to France, forming a **vocal anti-Algerian lobby**.  <br>- France only admitted it was a &quot;war&quot; (not a &quot;police operation&quot;) in **1999**—and still refuses to fully apologize for torture or massacres.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*5. It Shapes the Maghreb’s Geopolitics*</b>  <br>- Algeria’s support for the <b>*Polisario Front*</b> in Western Sahara is rooted in its own anti-colonial struggle—a direct challenge to Morocco.  <br>- The war poisoned <b>*Franco-Algerian relations*</b> for decades (e.g., visa disputes, gas deals, memory wars).  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*Why It Still Matters*</b>  <br>- **Colonial Apologies**: Macron has taken steps (admitting torture, opening archives), but Algeria demands reparations.  <br>- **Immigrant Identity**: France’s Algerian diaspora (the largest in Europe) grapples with **generational trauma**.  <br>- **Authoritarianism**: Algeria’s regime still uses the war to **silence critics**, claiming dissent &quot;betrays the martyrs.&quot;  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*Final Thought*</b>  <br>This wasn’t just a war—it was a **reckoning**. It proved empires could bleed to death, that liberation could come at a moral cost, and that the wounds of history never fully heal.",

        "text": "​@wijdaxNo, Morocco did <b>*not*</b> effectively occupy or administer Western Sahara before Spain&#39;s colonization in **1884**. Here’s the historical breakdown:<br><br>### <b>*1. Pre-Spanish Period (Before 1884)*</b><br>- Western Sahara was a <b>*sparsely populated desert region*</b> inhabited by <b>*nomadic Sahrawi tribes*</b> (such as the Reguibat, Oulad Delim, and Tekna).<br>- These tribes had **loose, shifting allegiances**—sometimes paying tribute to the Moroccan Sultan (based in cities like Marrakesh or Fez) or Mauritanian emirates, but often acting independently.<br>- <b>*No permanent Moroccan administration*</b> (taxation, courts, or military garrisons) existed in Western Sahara.<br><br>### <b>*2. Morocco’s Historical Claims*</b><br>- Morocco argues that some Sahrawi tribes <b>*pledged allegiance (bay&#39;ah)*</b> to Moroccan sultans in the 17th–19th centuries.<br>- However, these oaths were **symbolic and intermittent**, not proof of direct control. The Sahara remained **de facto autonomous**.<br><br>### <b>*3. Spain’s Colonization (1884)*</b><br>- At the **Berlin Conference (1884–85)**, Spain claimed Western Sahara as **&quot;Spanish Sahara&quot;**, with no Moroccan resistance.<br>- Morocco itself was <b>*weak and fragmented*</b> in the 19th century, struggling against European encroachment (France occupied Morocco in **1912**).<br><br>### <b>*4. International Court of Justice (ICJ) Ruling (1975)*</b><br>- The ICJ examined Morocco’s historical claims and <b>*rejected*</b> the argument of pre-colonial sovereignty:<br>  &gt; <b>&quot;The Court’s conclusion is that the materials and information presented to it do not establish any tie of territorial sovereignty between Western Sahara and the Moroccan Sultanate.&quot;</b>  <br>- Instead, the ICJ affirmed the **right of Sahrawis to self-determination**.<br><br>### <b>*5. Post-1975: Moroccan Occupation*</b><br>- After Spain withdrew, Morocco <b>*militarily occupied*</b> Western Sahara (via the **Green March**), despite the ICJ ruling.<br>- Today, Morocco controls ~80% of the territory, but the **UN still classifies it as a non-self-governing colony**.<br><br>### <b>*Conclusion*</b>  <br>Morocco had <b>*no sustained political or military control*</b> over Western Sahara before Spain. Its current claim relies on <b>*post-1975 occupation**, not pre-colonial rule. The **Polisario Front*</b> and international law still demand a **self-determination referendum**.",

I think you have orders from Israel.

Or is it the population in Morocco (the part controlled by Morocco ), to which the Polisario will refuse as they see it’s not fair. So what now ? Give us a solution to this. Oh I know, since a referendum is practically impossible, the UN should look for other alternatives, and for the past 20 years the Moroccan autonomy plan was the only solution that’s realistic and what happened now with this resolution is just the UN finally adopting it as a basis of future discussions.

In September 1991, the UN brokered a ceasefire and a simple deal: the 16 year old war would end, and within a year, the UN would organize a referendum to let the Sahrawi peoples decide their future. To make this happen, the UN created a mission called MINURSO. As the voter registry was being made, Morocco flooded Western Sahara with Moroccan settlers and demanded that they be allowed to vote (which cleary would influence the referendum greatly to their favor). This directly violated the Geneva Conventions: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population into the territory it occupies”. For more than 30 years, this referendum was not held. There was another referendum in 2007 that was proposed by James Baker, former secretary of state of US, but again Morocco declined… I hope you understand what is going on.",

These are the 3 options that exist for this conflict!<br><br>What do you think? Would the sahrawis be happy enough with big autonomy where they can manage their own educational, healthcare, and budget systems with equal rights and the regonition of Hassaniya arabic, or is independence the only way?<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to hear your answer 🤔, and also when you give the answer, please give me the reason or pusher behind it 👍",

I’ve been personally involved with the Sahrawi (fyi it’s pronounced sah-rawi) community living in the refugee camps in Algeria since 2012, teaching and facilitating training programs in Smara, Layounne and Boujdour each year. The situation on the camps is not improving, 50 years on people still live on emergency food rations, water is bought in each day by tankers and malnutrition is widespread. The more the international community look away the worse the situation is for those in the camps and those living under the brutal Moroccan occupation. Let’s stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the Sahrawi people, they are brave, gracious, generous, resilient and compassionate despite years of persecution by Morocco and neglect by the international community.",

The period after the fall of the idrisids was marked by instability with neither tribe being able to fully assert its control and that&#39;s why saying that algeria conquered morocco is just wild, considering that the almoravids who came after did actually conquer parts of algeria (present day tlemcen, wahran and algiers).",

It has been the subject of a long-standing conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front, which seeks independence for the territory. \n Morocco claims sovereignty over the region and has established a government presence there, while the Polisario Front maintains control over some parts of the territory. The conflict has been ongoing since the 1970s and has involved military clashes, political negotiations, and international mediation efforts.  Currently, the United Nations maintains a peacekeeping mission in the region known as MINURSO, which is tasked with monitoring a ceasefire that was agreed to in 1991. There have been some recent diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict, but it remains unresolved.",

It's sad that Algeria is so deaf to calls of constructing the Grand Maghreb and the Algerian officials are keen on feeding animosity, conflict and terrorist groups in the South. Morocco is scoring points and gaining legitimacy for its national cause and many countries today support its territorial integrity.",

It is not a question of colonaziation as the polizario propaganda suggest, it is a question of a Morocco that's trying to protect its territorial unity and its right to be liberated from the shadows of colonization that left not only Morocco but all African nations stuck in ruins of the past. All these conflicts only benefit global powers in keeping an upper hand on Africa and using its resources, by making it unstable and unable to be independent.",

Therefore, Morocco who had already lost the territory of Mauritania and Eastern Sahara (Western Algeria - Tindouf, Béchard, Adrar and Tidikelt) was not going to let this one go! \n\n2. The area on the other side of the wall is not controlled by the Polisario. Rather, it’s a forbidden to people demilitarised buffer zone!

Long story short, the senile so called generals cannot pull the gang out of the dialogue roundtable since this time the BIG EYE is closely watching over them, trust me! the old feral rates will be hammered the moment they think of misbehaving or missing around with the American led initiative. The time is set for the long overdue final episode where everything is pre-settled, pre-defined and pre-agreed upon in advance. NO ROOMS for last minute surprises, Moroccan brains finalized the work knowing where the communication will lead. Hence, nothing left to chance or coincidence. To lay it more blatantly: accept my designed autonomy plan or get doomed for real. The gang along with their master’s unwillingly embraced Option 1. Period.\r\n\r\nMedia and diplomacy will mince words to make it look like this is a consensual agreement. In light of this, Morocco was also urged not to add salt to injury spreading across the alergian corpse.",

The Turks know well the borders of their province Eyalet El Jazair.  Moroccans know well their borders and we will not allow Europe nor Algeria to dictate what they are.  The Sahara was Morocco since the 12th century during the reign of the Almoravid Royal family.  It was also Moroccan during the reign of Almohad, Merinids, Saadi dynasties.  And was Moroccan before the region was colonized by Spain in the 19th century during the Alaouites dynasty.  Europe stripped many Moroccan lands just like they did to Turkey after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.  We will not play European games here.  And we will certainly not allow a communist militia set up a communist republic in our lands.  If Europeans are bored, they can give independence to Catalunya, Basque Country, Corsica or Scotland.  Or Kabylia for Algeria!",

It has begun constructing a railway from Tindouf to the Mediterranean to reduce dependence on Mauritania, which may one day refuse to renew the deal. Other African routes exist but are far too distant. Algeria’s core obsession remains: gaining direct access to the Atlantic, ideally through the Moroccan Sahara — the closest and most strategic gateway.",

        "text": "Tebboune is pouring billions of dollars into deals that would give Algeria access to ports in the Sahara to export iron from mines in Tindouf — land that was originally Moroccan and lies very close to the Moroccan Sahara.<br><br>In 2024, Algeria signed a contract with Mauritania to finance a railway from the Tindouf mines to the port of Nouakchott. The deal allows Algeria to use Nouakchott’s port to export iron, with the contract renewable every 10 years. The railway is about 1,800 km long, while the Moroccan port of Laayoune is only 400 km away. If the Polisario were to take the Sahara, Algeria could use Laayoune for free and forever — likely the real bargain behind their support.<br><br>Still, Algeria seems to be losing hope in this dream. It has started building a railway from Tindouf to the Mediterranean to avoid relying fully on Mauritania, which could one day refuse to renew the deal. Other African routes exist, but they are too far. Algeria’s real obsession remains: direct access to the Atlantic, ideally through the Moroccan Sahara — the closest and most strategic outlet.",

        "text": "I am trying to understand what will make the UN come to a decision about the Moroccan Sahara? Must the whole world recognize it? That will not happen. Because, .... because the most of those countries don't care that much about us and above that they have no clue about our history.\n\nNormally, the most sensible approach to solving the problem is to involve the countries that are essentially responsible for this. Ofcourse I am talking here about France and Spain. At this moment it seems like Spain and France are saying to us: 'we have nothing to do with this problem, fight about it with the algeriens and if you want us to support you at the UN than you must let us continue exploitating the country'. \n\nParadoxically, the UN is helping France and Spain to escape from their historical involvement, responsibility and culpability in creating this disaster and points only to Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania and Polisario as those who should negotiate for a solution. Obviously a try of the Western World to avoid any kind of direct involvement and confrontation but at the same time they use and abuse this political problem to exploit and rob Morocco of its wealth. Not to mention the current unrest and division in North Africa. This proves that the UN is nothing but a tool of the West to continue their colonial ambitions, now on an economic level. \n\nWhile in deciding on the Sahara file, France and Spain must be overwhelmed present and decisive. Their involvement in making a decision possible is not only needed but even obligated. Because it's Spain and France who divided Morocco and therefore it's their responsibility to restore the stability and unity of the country again. \n\nIn fact making Spain and France 'admit that they divided' Morocco is already a recognition of the Moroccan Sahara, that immediately 'must' be by the whole world. \n\n*** so many thanks for sharing ****👍",

I am telling  you that the current alaouite dynastie in morocco controled that land before colonasation that has nothing to do with some vague historical claim, in fact the king hassan 2 went to the internationl court of justice with that fact before having the green light to do the green marche in his words, and you seem to think that morocco was against the referendum, it&#39;s again not true at all. The issue is about WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REFERENDUM.  We will not accept that mauritanians and algerian sahraouis participate. You will not get it what untill you have a separiste groupe in your countrie asking for independence and i am sure there are as there are in almost every country. So respectfully tell me where are you from i will see if you support your own separatiste mouvements 😀 until then you should understand when moroccans get emotional about that.",

That s is why morocco is asking for the identity and the total number of the people in the algerian camps. But polizario those not want ti give that information, moreover alot of known figures of the separiste mouvement are known to be from mauritania or part of morocco that are not in the disputed region and so one.",

Morocco needs to agree on the referundum as stated by United Nations and agreed by the former king",

The hole area is populated by less than 1 million people. Polizario is not agreeing to give the identity of the people in the tindouf camps in algeria. They bringed in anyone from mauritania, algerian sahara or mali in the name of a state based on cultural and ethnic identity. Morocco asked to use the lists of spain to know who was living there in 1975 so they can refuse the algerians, mauritanians... but polizario considere that any &quot;sahraoui&quot; who is separatiste and is in the camp in algeria should participate. But anyway even if what you say is true so what ? Catalogna did a referendum 80% agreed ti separate from spain and spain decided that they don t care about it. In the same way moroccan will never agree to loss their lands and the only solution for the separatiste today is to have autonomy and make their rules but under moroccan soverenty. Where is the referendum for pays basque where the referendum the republic of kabylie, chaoui, twareg and so on almost in every single country there a separatiste mouvement but the world is going towards unity specialy in the developed countries. Why would we accept to be separated into countries of 600k people each when &quot;democratic europen countries refuse it for themselfs (even after a referendum of 80% for separation as the catalogna exemple).",

Remember when Macron brought Moh6th to Paris and made him sit near Trump and Putin? Then he &quot;slept&quot; to make press talk about him? Remember when France bombarded Libya and the 1st Arab Foreign Minister to visit Libya was the Moroccan? Remember when Uthmani read a resolution to condemn Sirian Gov on behalf of France and other countries? That&#39;s just a small example of &quot;remote control&quot; comand.",

There are more UN S.C discussions behind closed doors. <br>France is looking at its own interests.  They are protecting themselfs from any resolution that could hurt them in the future. Because they are also dealing with seperatism at home with the corsicans and they have 2 non self governing territories to look after.  The rest of your claims about morocco and its foreign policy are just speculations. <br>Keep believing that  Algeria is spending billions of dollars in this conflict, because they love the sahrawis so much while butchering  250.000 of their own people during the black decade. 250.000 people!  Thats half of the total sahrawi population.",

        "text": "@ubuntu2551 France accepted the Referendum in New Caledonia. Don&#39;t think she&#39;s afraid of that. France is afraid of a weak Moroccan king which will make millions of Moroccans emigrate to EU and France will loose a strategic ally which is the French manouvres maker in FranceAfrique, including Coup d&#39; Eta and killings of African presidents who rebel against France. It&#39;s not a coincidence that the best allies of France in Africa are exactly the best allies of Morocco: Senegal, Cote d&#39;Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, etc. Its so clear!. Do you think Algeria really spent billions for the sake of Polisario? You can say millions and I agree, but billions? I myself saw the refugees and their army. Believe me, very little was spent there. I also don&#39;t believe the story that Polisario leaders have bank accounts abroad because simply Moroccan Secret Services, among the strongest in Africa and Arab, world have found their accounts and houses abroad. False indeed. <br>Yaap, terrorism attacked Algeria and its leaders went to hide in Morocco. Financial support came from everywhere and there were huge battles for security but also there were mistakes. Remember your king bombarded innocent Saharawis and people of the Rif. There also thousands were massacred. Thousands died in Tazmamaret, Agdez, Maguna, Black jail, etc. Your house is made of crystal so don&#39;t throw stones to the others.",

France doesnt need to be afraid of a weak Morocco. There is a heir to the throne and a good gouvermeny to reassure this. And ofcourse our long history is a witness to this.<br>The francophone countries that are being influenced by france are the colonial creations of france. So this is common sense that it has some influence over them. This also includes  algerie with the signing of the accords of evian after a referendum. With this signing france get to control and exploit all their natural ressources and a lot more. <br>Algeria did spent billions of dollars to keep polisario alive as a tool in their geostrategy. This info is available and even algerian journalists and politicians have widely reported this. <br>The crackdown on those people by king hassan came after 2 assasination attempts and the hostility against the territorial integrity of the country. <br>The rest of your allegations are speculation and based on propaganda.",

It's only logical for Morocco to recover territory that was stripped from it due to European colonization as the local populations who are Sahraouis had documented ties to the kingdom of Morocco throughout the dynasties that ruled it as stated by the ICJ in the Hague. Any other theories that call for establishing a state legitimize Western colonization and imperialism. What's ironic is that no one questions whether Algeria's southern regions are part of Algeria regardless of the local populations there because Algeria simply inherited it's borders from colonial France.",

        "text": "France granted independence to Morocco (1956) before Algeria because the situations in both countries were fundamentally different. In Morocco, France had only imposed a protectorate (1912), keeping the Sultan as a symbolic authority, which made negotiations and a political settlement easier, especially after the 1953 exile and 1955 return of Sultan Mohammed V under strong popular, Arab, and American pressure. In contrast, Algeria had been considered an integral part of France since 1830, divided into French départements, with nearly a million European settlers, fertile agricultural lands, oil and gas resources, and a deeply entrenched colonial infrastructure; thus, losing Algeria meant tearing away “a piece of France itself.” After World War II and the defeat in Indochina (1946–1954), France was militarily exhausted and facing three simultaneous nationalist uprisings in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. To reduce pressure, it chose to negotiate independence for Morocco and Tunisia in 1956, redeploying tens of thousands of troops to Algeria, which it saw as an existential struggle. Consequently, Morocco and Tunisia’s independence was less a generous gesture than a strategic military decision, allowing France to focus on the bloody Algerian War (1954–1962), the last great colonial conflict in North Africa.",

The Sahara was also Moroccan during the reign of Almohad, Merinids, Saadi dynasties.  And was Moroccan before the region was colonized by Spain in the 19th century during the Alaouites dynasty.  The current king’s great grand grandfather (Moulay Hassan 1st) even financed and order to build the bastion of Smara in 1869, to fight French and Spanish colonization of the region.  We will not play European games here.  And will certainly not allow a communist militia to set up a communist republic in our lands.  If Europeans are bored, they can give independence to Catalunya, Basque Country, Corsica or Scotland.  Maybe you should support them in that endeavor.  Regards.",

        "text": "Yes, unlike your usual lies and propaganda, here&#39;s a very easily verifiable expertise: Indeed, Moroccan phosphate is naturally heavily polluted and highly toxic for plant as well as for marine life. Studies have confirmed bioaccumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms, indicating significant contamination of the marine environment. A 2006 study found cadmium contamination in shellfish near OCP discharge points, and a 2013 study recorded high levels of heavy metal contamination in saltwater lagoons near OCP sites.  Air pollution is evident in towns near industrial sites. Safi, home to one of OCP’s major fertilizer plants, is often shrouded in smog, and residents report health issues linked to exposure to industrial emissions. Workers in these facilities have reported respiratory problems and cancers, with some attributing their illnesses to long-term exposure to dust and gases from ammonia, fluoride, phosphoric, and sulphuric acid, despite minimal protective measures. The industry discharges large amounts of phosphogypsum—a radioactive waste byproduct—into the Atlantic Ocean near Safi and Jorf Lasfar.  This waste, composed of calcium sulfate and other salts, releases heavy metals into seawater, with measurable pollution detected up to 6 kilometers south of the discharge points. Studies have confirmed bioaccumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms, indicating significant contamination of the marine environment.",

There are plenty of Moroccan Jews, inside Morocco and abroad, who oppose the occupation and the killing of innocents.

This decision, however, was not based on any cultural or national differences, but rather on the country’s distance and the practical challenges of governance. Later, the Bedouins living in Western Sahara, encouraged by Algeria, began demanding the same independence that had been granted to Mauritania. When these demands turned violent, Morocco rejected the comparison, maintaining that the situation in Western Sahara was fundamentally different.",

Not only are Mauritanians and Sahrawis distinct people, their land was never truly part of morocco and it was mainly just tribal leaders that had agreements with Morocco. Mauritania also got independence from France, not Morocco. Not to mention, Mauritania invaded Western Sahara. Spain promised an independence referendum to the local sahrawi people but instead made an agreement with Morocco and Mauritania to carve up western sahara. The local sahrawis fought both the spaniards and the invaders.",

This decision, however, was not based on any cultural or national differences, but rather on the country’s distance and the practical challenges of governance. Later, the Bedouins living in Western Sahara, encouraged by Algeria, began demanding the same independence that had been granted to Mauritania. When these demands turned violent, Morocco rejected the comparison, maintaining that the situation in Western Sahara was fundamentally different.",

The agreement allows Algeria to use Nouakchott’s port to export iron, with the contract renewable every 10 years. The railway stretches about 1,800 km, while the Moroccan port of Laayoune is only 400 km away. If the Polisario were to seize the Sahara, Algeria could use Laayoune freely and permanently — likely the true motive behind their support.\n\nYet Algeria appears to be losing faith in this scenario. It has begun constructing a railway from Tindouf to the Mediterranean to reduce dependence on Mauritania, which may one day refuse to renew the deal. Other African routes exist but are far too distant. Algeria’s core obsession remains: gaining direct access to the Atlantic, ideally through the Moroccan Sahara — the closest and most strategic gateway.",

        "text": "I am trying to understand what will make the UN come to a decision about the Moroccan Sahara? Must the whole world recognize it? That will not happen. Because, .... because the most of those countries don't care that much about us and above that they have no clue about our history.\n\nNormally, the most sensible approach to solving the problem is to involve the countries that are essentially responsible for this. Ofcourse I am talking here about France and Spain. At this moment it seems like Spain and France are saying to us: 'we have nothing to do with this problem, fight about it with the algeriens and if you want us to support you at the UN than you must let us continue exploitating the country'. \n\nParadoxically, the UN is helping France and Spain to escape from their historical involvement, responsibility and culpability in creating this disaster and points only to Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania and Polisario as those who should negotiate for a solution. Obviously a try of the Western World to avoid any kind of direct involvement and confrontation but at the same time they use and abuse this political problem to exploit and rob Morocco of its wealth. Not to mention the current unrest and division in North Africa. This proves that the UN is nothing but a tool of the West to continue their colonial ambitions, now on an economic level. \n\nWhile in deciding on the Sahara file, France and Spain must be overwhelmed present and decisive. Their involvement in making a decision possible is not only needed but even obligated. Because it's Spain and France who divided Morocco and therefore it's their responsibility to restore the stability and unity of the country again. \n\nIn fact making Spain and France 'admit that they divided' Morocco is already a recognition of the Moroccan Sahara, that immediately 'must' be by the whole world. \n\n*** so many thanks for sharing ****👍",

If the Polisario were to seize the Sahara, Algeria could use Laayoune freely and permanently — likely the true motive behind their support.<br><br>Yet Algeria appears to be losing faith in this scenario. It has begun constructing a railway from Tindouf to the Mediterranean to reduce dependence on Mauritania, which may one day refuse to renew the deal. Other African routes exist but are far too distant. Algeria’s core obsession remains: gaining direct access to the Atlantic, ideally through the Moroccan Sahara — the closest and most strategic gateway.",

They cant survive without algeria and their north korean like military government rule. Algeria should feed its own. People there can’t afford food but out of pure spite toward Morocco, Algeria does this. Algerias weapons are mostly soviet era and some new Russian while Morocco has access to the best weapons land, sea and air from the U.S. \nAlgeria can not purchase weapons from the United States since they sided with the communists during the cold war. I have nothing at all towards Algerian people as they very similar to Moroccans but boy do I hate their government of 80 year old war generals",

        "text": "The Sahrawis in Tindouf are more then Welcome to return to the Moroccan Sahara. They are being held by Algeria's puppet the Polisario in these poor living conditions. Morocco would welcome them back absolutely. This video is completely biased as it makes Spain, Algeria and  the Polisario look good. Spain is the criminal state that invaded our Sahara which historically belongs to us our kingdom/sultanate. The Spanish government alongside the Algerian regime are the enemies of Morocco, but we are strong and we will defend the integrity of out land. Spain did the same thing by betraying the U.S by allowing Hugo Carvajal a Venezuelan criminal escape. Spain is no stranger when it comes to betrayal. I have nothing against the Spanish people, but not for one minute I would consider their government as an ally. \n\nMorocco tries to cooperate with Spain and Algeria on numerous occasions. King Mohammed VI has urged the Algerian government for a dialogue to try and normalise relations and to work towards neutrality for the opening of the borders. Algeria's arrogant regime ignores this and this takes a toll on the Moroccan and Algerian populations who have family and friends who want to visit each other. Morocco as well constantly does Spain's dirty work by protecting Ceuta's and Melilia's borders even though those enclaves belong to Morocco and this is still a sign of colonialism in 2021. Morocco still puts up with that, but Spain refuses to cooperate and yet again this is the state that caused this problem in the first place by invading the Sahara and creating instability. Finally Spain has the Catalan and the Basque movements that they worry about, and Morocco always supported a modern Spanish state undivided, but Spain does the opposite to us. Spain is not our ally and we as Moroccans will defend the integrity of our Kingdom. Allah Alwatan Almalik!",

First  that is not an artillery weapon , the weapon in question  here is an anti air gun used against low flying targets  , its true that it can be used against ground targets for medium distance , but jugding  by the angle of the muzzel  i would say that   he is just shooting the air , you should also know that the ammunition used in this particular  weapon ( zpu 23 ) get self destruct once they exceed a certain distance  in ordre to avoid falling down randomly over cities or populated area .<br>Sencondly . Firing randomly is the opposite of firing effectively . The artillery system must be accurate to have any effect on the enemy , if not its just a waste of money .",

Even now in their camps they dont let sahrawis walk free and there is no form of any freedom and only slavery, extortion, torture and killing. Morocco will ensure that the sahara is and will stay Moroccan where everybody can enjoy! Sahrawis are welcome to their homeland morocco with full rights. \n\nWe welcome the whole world to see transparantly what is happening and we work with the united nations and other neighbouring (unfriendly states lile algeria and mauritania) to try and solve it peacefully. Algeria is hostile behind the scenes and also the days of the polisario will be over if they continue provocations and hinder freedom of navigation in the guergerrat border area. \n\nWe went in with the United Nations Army so they can monitor moroccos actions. What did the polisario do? Blocked the way entry for the UN staff personell to tindouf. You block international traffic and put up poor illegal roadchecks to terrorize traffic of west north africa and the rest of the world.

MOROCCO ENVAITED THE SAHARA IN 1975 MILITARILY BUT ALSO BY THE POPULATION OF COUNTRIES OF SANHADJA BY MOROCCANS. IT IS WORSE THAN ISRAELI COLONIZATION (because at least the Jews were also from Palestine). WESTERN SAHARA HAS NEVER BELONGED TO MOROCCO NOR HISTORICALLYhttps://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b53103889w/f259.item.r=atlas%20cartes.zoom NOR ETHNICALLY AND NO MOROCCAN HAS SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDED THEIR EVIDENCE.    THEY HAVE ONLY BLA BLA. IF THE MOON IS AT THEIR RANGE, THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS MOVED ON THE MOON IS A MOROCCAN. IN COLONIZING FORCE THE WESTERN SAHARA, MOROCCO OBLIGED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SAHRAOUIS REFUSING THIS COLONIZATION BY FORCE AND CRIMINELLE, TO REFER TO ALGERIA WHICH WILL GIVE THEM THEIR SALUTE AND HUMAN PROTECTION, OTHERWISE THEY WERE DECEMBERED. MOROCCO IN FEAR OF ALGERIA. IT WILL NEVER CONTINUE TO CONTINUE THE SAHRAOUIS IN ALGERIAN TERRITORY OTHERWISE MOROCCO WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE CARD. HUMAN RIGHTS ARE TOTALLY FOUNDED IN WESTERN SAHARA. THE MOST FAMOUS NGOs IN THE WORLD IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS DO NOT STOP SIGNING IT HIGH AND STRONG BUT THE WESTERN MEDIA BETWEEN THE HANDS OF ZIONISTS AND PATRONS CORRUPTED BY THE MAKHZEN CENSOR THEIR CRITICISM OF DISTRESS. TO STAY IN THE WESTERN SAHARA, MOROCCO FOLLOWS BY THE CORRUPTION OF WESTERN POLITICIANS, PARTICULARLY FRENCH. WHAT EXPLAINS THAT ALL FRENCH POLITICIANS HAVE VILLAS IN MOROCCO. FRANCE, WHICH IS IN MOROCCO AS THE STARTING POINT OF A NEW AFRICAN COLONIZATION, A VISION TOTALLY EXCEEDED AND DANGEROUS FOR THE FRENCH AS THE AFRICANS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THEIR DESTINY AND ARE NO MORE DUPERS. NELSON MANDELA WAS ONE OF THE MOST FERTILIZING DEFENDERS OF THE SAHRAOUIS. AFRICANS WAKE UP, PUT YOUR OWN EXISTENCE IN DANGER\nPS. THE POLISARIO FRONT HAS BEEN FIGHTING SPAIN SINCE 1973, AND WAS NOT CREATED AS THE MOROCCAN LEADERS SAY FROM 1975 BY ALGERIA. THEY ARE VICIOUS LEADERS AND MANIPULATORS. AND THE PEOPLE SAHRAOUI IS A PEOPLE OF SANHADJA AS IT IS INDICATED ON THE OLD GEOGRAPHICAL MAPS OF THE WORLD. AND NEVER BELONGED TO MOROCCO",

OÙ SONT SES ORGANISATIONS FANTOCHES FRANCAISES DES DROITS DE L'HOMME CRÉÉES JUSTE POUR SURVEILLER L'ALGERIE ET ÉMETTRE DES MENSONGES A NOTRE ENCONTRE? POURQUOI L'EMBARGO SUR L'ALGERIE QUE W. BUSH AVAIT DÉNONCÉ L'INJUSTICE D'UN TEL EMBARGO EN ACCUSANT LA FRANCE, ET LA FRANCE RESTE MUETTE POUR LE MAROC. C'EST CA QUE LA COMMUNAUTE INTERNATIONALE DOIT SAVOIR. LA FRANCE EST DEVENUE UN PAYS SIONISTE ET IMPERIALISTE ET C'EST LA VÉRITÉ ET C'EST AUSSI L'OPINION DE LA COMMUNAUTÉ INTERNATIONALE. POLISARIO DEMANDEZ LA PROTECTION DE L'ALGERIE, LA JUSTICE ET LE DROIT INTERNATIONALE EST AVEC VOUS",

ils demandent au maroc et à la mauritanie d&#39;occuper le sahara occidental pour se venger des sahraouis mais aussi pour emmerder (souhait d&#39;israel) l&#39;algérie qui soutenait le polisatio contre l&#39;espagne. le maroc et la mauritanie acceptent de partager le gâteau sahraoui en écrasant sa population. le nord pour le maroc et le sud pour la mauritanie. le polisario trahi par le maroc et la mauritanie continua le combat. ils chassent la mauritanie du sud du sahara en 1979, et le maroc profitant de la défaite mauritanienne face aux sahraouis occupe automatiquement comme des charognards, et aujourd&#39;hui les marocains nous saoulent de &quot;l&#39;intégrité territoriale&quot; inexistante avant 1979, mais devient existante après le retrait de la mauritanie. donc déjà on mesure le vice marocain. le maroc était à deux doigt de perdre le sahara occidental face aux guerriers sahraouis sans le soutien d&#39;israel qui voulait absolument maintenir la région sous tension pour embêter l&#39;algérie, et israel vous a même recommandé de construire le mur au sahara pour vous protéger des attaquent meurtrières sahraouis. après plusieurs combats les sahraouis ont fait plus de 6000 prisonniers marocains, que le roi du maroc refuse de récupérer car vous êtes une sous race pour lui et vous comptez pour de la merde pour lui, heureusement qu&#39;il y a l&#39;ONU qui pense à vous peuple esclave marocain. le cesser le feu est instauré depuis 1991, pour l&#39;organisation d&#39;un référendum d&#39;autodétermination, mais depuis le maroc gagne du temps (grace aux manœuvres franco israélienne) et fuit ses responsabilités. les sahraouis sont des adorateurs de dieu l&#39;unique le tout puissant contrairement aux marocains qui sont des adorateurs de rois pour qui ils se prosternent comme des gueux en insultant et en défiant notre dieu l&#39;unique soubhanou. les sahraouis ne se prosterneront JAMAIS pour leur roi dieu, NOTEZ LE, et on verra qui est plus puissant leur roi dieu et israel ou notre dieu l&#39;unique soubhanou! la guerre? y a pas de problème, mais sachez qu&#39;un sahraoui mort est un chahide il va au paradis et un marocain mort est une charogne et il va en enfer se prosterner pour leurs rois à jamais en enfer",

Vas te faire pardonner<br> <br>’D&#39;après Abdullah Ibn Omar, qu’Allah les agrée, le Messager d’Allah (ﷺ) a dit : « Tout homme qui dit à son frère – ô mécréant – alors cette parole atteint l’un d’entre eux. ».<br><br>Premièrement, ce hadith met en garde les musulmans et les musulmanes contre le fait d’accuser le musulman et porter sur lui le jugement de mécréance, comme en l’interpelant « ô mécréant » ou le critiquer et lui dire : « tu es un mécréant. ». Si le musulman dit cela à son frère musulman, soit cela est comme il l’a dit, c’est-à-dire que celui qu’il a décrit par la mécréance est réellement tombé dans la mécréance, soit ce n’est pas le cas, alors la parole revient sur celui qui l’a prononcée car il a jugé mécréant son frère musulman par transgression, sans qu’il n’est commis aucun péché. Ce qui est voulu est de mettre en garde les musulmans et les musulmanes contre le fait de désigner par la mécréance, l’hypocrisie ou l’association, le musulman sans aucune justification ni aucune preuve.",

        "text": "Western Sahara is Moroccan and it will remain so: the people are Moroccan, the flag is Moroccan, the institutions are Moroccan, the currency is Moroccan, etc. This is reality whether you like it or not. If you did not come to colonize our country, this problem will not exist. After leaving, the Algerians took the opportunity to create a scapegoat called the Polisario in order to steal our land. France gave a large territory to the Algerians by creating this country but by amputating the neighbors (such as for example the Moroccan eastern Sahara illegally given by France to Algeria as well as the amputation of the territories of Tunisia etc.). This pseudo parallel Israel/Palestine is unfounded, you simply repeat the words of the Algerian military junta while Western Sahara is historically Moroccan, there are documents that prove it. It&#39;s like Mauritania, which was historically Moroccan, that France amputated to create this country. In reality, I&#39;m more angry with France than with Spain, with whom we have historical ties that go back centuries. Today, France still protects its offspring, Algeria, which has been seeking conflicts for us for 50 years. Sahrawis live freely in the Moroccan Sahara, billions have been spent to develop the cities of Laayoune, Dakhla. Unlike the Sahrawis in the Tindouf camps in Algeria who have been living in tents for 50 years where they are kidnapped and tortured; where child soldiers are indoctrinated, trained by hezbollah chitte militias that the Algerian military junta brought in but the international community turns a blind eye because they need gas from Algeria, just like the case of the Tuaregs in Algeria, thrown in the desert:",

This strategy mirrors similar settler-colonial patterns seen in Crimea and the West Bank.\"",

        "text": "I love Morocco, but I don’t love their denial of self determination to the peoples of the Western Sahara, Africa’s Last Colony. For hundreds of years Morocco claimed large portions of Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands, Algeria, Mauritania and Mali. But time continues to move on and Europe grew stronger.  By the  1880s the Europeans began their conquest of Africa and by 1912 France and Spain had conquered the continents last stronghold, The Islamic Kingdom of Morocco. Only The Coptic Christian Empire of Ethiopia and Democratic Republic of Liberia remained independent from European Colonialism. \n\nWhen the Kingdom of Morocco finally won its independence from France in 1956, they began a noble effort of ridding itself of the Spanish enclaves that still survived on its territory. But their attempts to restore its claims on other former European colonies that had become independent such as the Socialist Republic of Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Federated Republic of Mali were rebuffed. And so Morocco focused its claims on the weakest and least populous Spanish Colony of the Western Sahara and in 1975, over 300,000 Moroccans peacefully marched into the northern part of the territory demanding reunification.  Spain capitulated and agreed to partition their colony between Morocco and Mauritania instead of granting self determination to Africa’s last European Colony. \n\nThe peoples of the Western Sahara considered this a betrayal and began a war of liberation. Inspired by the struggle of the Palestinians against Israeli occupation, the Sahrawis  formed their own PLO, known as POLISARIO in 1973 to fight for independence from not only Spain, but Morocco and Mauritania. Most had to flee in exile to Algeria, which agreed to support their rights of self determination and in 1976 they declared their independence. By 1978, they defeated the Mauritanians, who gave up their claims, but then Morocco annexed mostly all of the Western Sahara and built a Wall with land mines between their colony, which they annexed and the small area that had been liberated. \n\nYet even though I believe that Morocco rights to reclaim its pre 1912 territories is a noble cause, so do I believe in the cause of self determination of the Western Sahara. And therefore just as I believe in a Two-State solution between Israel and Palestine, so should there be, after nearly 50 years, a two-state solution between Morocco and the peoples of the Western Sahara.",

In 1991, the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army \"Polisario\" and Morocco agreed to a ceasefire and organize a referendum that would allow the Sahrawi people to determine their fate, but the referendum was never organized due to Morocco's obstruction, until the autonomy plan was proposed in 2007 and it was said that it was the only realistic solution and that it would not accept anything else. The issue is still in the United Nations until now and is classified as decolonization.\n\nThe right of self-determination for the Sahrawi people is supported by the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union... but it has not been implemented yet",
