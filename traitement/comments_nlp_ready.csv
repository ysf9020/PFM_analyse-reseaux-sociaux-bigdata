Here’s a breakdown:  <br><br>### <b>*1. Pre-Colonial Algeria*</b>  <br>- Before French colonization, Algeria was part of various North African empires (Numidians, Romans, Ottomans).  <br>- From 1516–1830, it was an <b>*Ottoman regency*</b> (autonomous province) with local rulers (*deys*).  <br><br>### <b>*2. French Colonization (1830–1962)*</b>  <br>- France invaded Algiers in **1830**, gradually conquering the territory.  <br>- By 1848, Algeria was declared <b>*French soil*</b> (not a colony but an integral part of France).  <br>- France imposed its administrative, educational, and economic systems, **dismantling traditional Algerian structures**.  <br><br>### <b>*3. Impact on Modern Algeria*</b>  <br>- <b>*Borders**: France defined Algeria’s modern borders, including the disputed **southern territories*</b> (later used for nuclear tests).  <br>- **Language &amp; Culture**: French became dominant; Arabic/Berber identity was suppressed.  <br>- **Political System**: Post-independence Algeria inherited France’s **centralized governance model**.  <br><br>### <b>*4. Independence (1962)*</b>  <br>- After a brutal <b>*8-year war*</b> (1954–1962), Algeria gained independence via the **Évian Accords**.  <br>- The **FLN (National Liberation Front)**, which led the revolution, established a socialist republic, **rejecting France’s legacy but retaining its administrative framework**.  <br><br>### <b>*5. Did France &quot;Create&quot; Algeria?*</b>  <br>- **No**: Algeria existed as a distinct region before France.  <br>- <b>*But**: Modern Algeria’s **state institutions, borders, and even some political elites*</b> (like the FLN) emerged in reaction to French rule.  <br><br>### <b>*Key Controversies*</b>  <br>- **Pieds-Noirs**: Over 1 million European settlers fled Algeria in 1962, leaving economic scars.  <br>- **Harkis**: Algerian collaborators with France were massacred post-independence.  <br>- **Neo-Colonialism**: France retained influence (oil/gas interests, military ties) until the 2020s.  <br><br>### <b>*Conclusion*</b>  <br>France didn’t &quot;create&quot; Algeria but **reshaped it violently**, leaving a legacy that still affects Algeria’s politics, language, and relations with Morocco (e.g., Western Sahara conflict).",0,2025-08-11T01:02:06Z,Ugzm7UsMj2g-A7nmBEZ4AaABAg,wijdaxalgeria as a modern nationstate was not created by france but its current borders administrative systems and aspects of its political identity were heavily shaped by french colonial rule heres a breakdown brbr b precolonial algeriab br before french colonization algeria was part of various north african empires numidians romans ottomans br from it was an bottoman regencyb autonomous province with local rulers deys brbr b french colonization b br france invaded algiers in gradually conquering the territory br by algeria was declared bfrench soilb not a colony but an integral part of france br france imposed its administrative educational and economic systems dismantling traditional algerian structures brbr b impact on modern algeriab br bborders france defined algerias modern borders including the disputed southern territoriesb later used for nuclear tests br language amp culture french became dominant arabicberber identity was suppressed br political system postindependence algeria inherited frances centralized governance model brbr b independence b br after a brutal byear warb algeria gained independence via the vian accords br the fln national liberation front which led the revolution established a socialist republic rejecting frances legacy but retaining its administrative framework brbr b did france quotcreatequot algeriab br no algeria existed as a distinct region before france br bbut modern algerias state institutions borders and even some political elitesb like the fln emerged in reaction to french rule brbr bkey controversiesb br piedsnoirs over million european settlers fled algeria in leaving economic scars br harkis algerian collaborators with france were massacred postindependence br neocolonialism france retained influence oilgas interests military ties until the s brbr bconclusionb brfrance didnt quotcreatequot algeria but reshaped it violently leaving a legacy that still affects algerias politics language and relations with morocco eg western sahara conflict

Here’s why it matters:<br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*1. It Destroyed France’s Illusion of Imperial Power*</b>  <br>- France had considered Algeria <b>*part of its homeland*</b> (unlike other colonies), making the war a <b>*civil war*</b> as much as a colonial conflict.  <br>- The conflict exposed France’s **systematic use of torture**, mass internment camps, and collective punishment, shocking the world and fracturing French society.  <br>- It led to the <b>*collapse of the French Fourth Republic*</b> (1958) and brought **de Gaulle to power**, who eventually accepted Algerian independence despite fierce opposition (including assassination attempts by far-right militias).  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*2. It Redefined What &quot;Decolonization&quot; Could Look Like*</b>  <br>- Unlike peaceful transitions in British Africa, Algeria’s war proved that **violence was often the price of freedom**—inspiring armed struggles from **Palestine to South Africa**.  <br>- The FLN’s tactics (urban guerrilla warfare, international diplomacy) became a **playbook for liberation movements**.  <br>- It forced the UN to confront colonialism head-on, making Algeria a **symbol of the Global South’s rise**.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*3. It Created Modern Algeria—For Better or Worse*</b>  <br>- The war <b>*killed 300,000–1 million Algerians*</b> (6–20% of the population) and left deep scars.  <br>- The FLN’s victory established a <b>*one-party socialist state*</b> that still dominates Algeria today, stifling dissent under the banner of &quot;revolutionary legitimacy.&quot;  <br>- **Post-war Algeria became a Cold War battleground**, aligning with the USSR and hosting revolutionaries like Che Guevara.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*4. It Haunts France to This Day*</b>  <br>- The war split France: **Leftists supported Algerian independence**, while far-right militants (OAS) bombed Paris to stop it.  <br>- Over <b>*1 million French settlers (Pieds-Noirs)*</b> fled to France, forming a **vocal anti-Algerian lobby**.  <br>- France only admitted it was a &quot;war&quot; (not a &quot;police operation&quot;) in **1999**—and still refuses to fully apologize for torture or massacres.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*5. It Shapes the Maghreb’s Geopolitics*</b>  <br>- Algeria’s support for the <b>*Polisario Front*</b> in Western Sahara is rooted in its own anti-colonial struggle—a direct challenge to Morocco.  <br>- The war poisoned <b>*Franco-Algerian relations*</b> for decades (e.g., visa disputes, gas deals, memory wars).  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*Why It Still Matters*</b>  <br>- **Colonial Apologies**: Macron has taken steps (admitting torture, opening archives), but Algeria demands reparations.  <br>- **Immigrant Identity**: France’s Algerian diaspora (the largest in Europe) grapples with **generational trauma**.  <br>- **Authoritarianism**: Algeria’s regime still uses the war to **silence critics**, claiming dissent &quot;betrays the martyrs.&quot;  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*Final Thought*</b>  <br>This wasn’t just a war—it was a **reckoning**.

Here’s the historical breakdown:<br><br>### <b>*1. Pre-Spanish Period (Before 1884)*</b><br>- Western Sahara was a <b>*sparsely populated desert region*</b> inhabited by <b>*nomadic Sahrawi tribes*</b> (such as the Reguibat, Oulad Delim, and Tekna).<br>- These tribes had **loose, shifting allegiances**—sometimes paying tribute to the Moroccan Sultan (based in cities like Marrakesh or Fez) or Mauritanian emirates, but often acting independently.<br>- <b>*No permanent Moroccan administration*</b> (taxation, courts, or military garrisons) existed in Western Sahara.<br><br>### <b>*2. Morocco’s Historical Claims*</b><br>- Morocco argues that some Sahrawi tribes <b>*pledged allegiance (bay&#39;ah)*</b> to Moroccan sultans in the 17th–19th centuries.<br>- However, these oaths were **symbolic and intermittent**, not proof of direct control. The Sahara remained **de facto autonomous**.<br><br>### <b>*3. Spain’s Colonization (1884)*</b><br>- At the **Berlin Conference (1884–85)**, Spain claimed Western Sahara as **&quot;Spanish Sahara&quot;**, with no Moroccan resistance.<br>- Morocco itself was <b>*weak and fragmented*</b> in the 19th century, struggling against European encroachment (France occupied Morocco in **1912**).<br><br>### <b>*4. International Court of Justice (ICJ) Ruling (1975)*</b><br>- The ICJ examined Morocco’s historical claims and <b>*rejected*</b> the argument of pre-colonial sovereignty:<br>  &gt; <b>&quot;The Court’s conclusion is that the materials and information presented to it do not establish any tie of territorial sovereignty between Western Sahara and the Moroccan Sultanate.&quot;</b>  <br>- Instead, the ICJ affirmed the **right of Sahrawis to self-determination**.<br><br>### <b>*5. Post-1975: Moroccan Occupation*</b><br>- After Spain withdrew, Morocco <b>*militarily occupied*</b> Western Sahara (via the **Green March**), despite the ICJ ruling.<br>- Today, Morocco controls ~80% of the territory, but the **UN still classifies it as a non-self-governing colony**.<br><br>### <b>*Conclusion*</b>  <br>Morocco had <b>*no sustained political or military control*</b> over Western Sahara before Spain.

And just like Israel, they have a project called “the Grand Morocco”, they intend to extend the territory France helped them enlarge, up to mid Algeria, and are very vocal about it. 
Wester Sahara is very rich in phosphate (that is critical for agriculture and will be lacking in a couple of years). So the deal was: you help us colonizing this country, and you get an endless supply (similar to the Quincy agreement between USA and Saudi Arabia).
The European Court found illegal the commerce of Wstern Sahara’s resources on behalf of Morocco to the EU, but guess what: they can’t care less as they are protected by the west. 

Most of the people don’t know about this because the US, France, Israel… (govt, not people) are complicit, and therefore the UN can’t do anything about it. 

Indeed.m, Algeria pressured the Security Council lately to resolve this issue. But America and France proposed a resolution to postpone it, instead (for more background look for : Security Council Resolution to extend MINURSO’s mandate for another year).

*A fact to consider, for people in the comments struggling with some Moroccans: they are propagandized, and that in addition to the fact that 49% of Moroccans suffer from mental illness (according to a recent report easily found on internet), they were also found to be the most dishonest people in the world by to 2 British studies (one in 2016 and one in 2019).

To Moroccans: stop saying “We didn’t know😢”. It’s the first thing that comes out of your mouth whenever you meet with an Algerian as Algeria is on the side of Wester Sahara.

4SakRNO_SMY,Western Sahara Morocco,UgxyOwiZ2HwbfrW7HLB4AaABAg,@DR_ndo,"Morocco's inconsistencies in claiming Western Sahara are very curious and funny:

1) By the 1830s, the decade of colonization, the Sultanate of Morocco did not have the territories of the Sahara. It did have them at its peak, but by the time Spain colonized the Sahara there was the Tekna confederation, which did not depend politically or religiously on Morocco.

2) It tries to feed back to the Almoravid and Almohad empires that came to have control over the Sahara, but these empires ended 800 years ago. That's a long time. Literally more time has passed since the fall of the Almohad empire than the entire history of Al-Andalus.

3) The ""Greater Morocco"" plan brings together all the territories that once belonged to those medieval dynasties as Moroccan territory. Does it remind you of anyone? (cough...cough...Israel...cough cough...)

4) Many Moroccans support the Palestinian cause, but the Moroccan government is pro-Israel. Isn't there a contradiction? It's literally the same phenomenon. A country claims a territory that belonged to it hundreds of years ago but at that time it didn't, and invades it without considering what the people there think.

5) Morocco in general of the Amazigh peoples who live there. Curiously, the Tekna Sahrawis are also an Amazigh people. Why did they have to exile themselves to Tindouf? Aren't they part of their own people?

6) If Morocco is truly the legitimate sovereign of the Sahara, why has it systematically refused to hold a referendum? Are they afraid of losing? Aren't the Sahrawis supposed to be part of their people, so why would they vote against Morocco?

Obviously all this happens because Morocco is based on an expansionist delusion with historical distortion. And even if we agreed with it, what is the point of invading a territory and starting a war with your supposedly own people? Expansionist delusions. There is no other explanation.

AmodSSavhK8,Western Sahara Morocco,UgwjZzZ-HSvfrh0l_0R4AaABAg,@DR_ndo,"Morocco's inconsistencies in claiming Western Sahara are very curious and funny:

1) By the 1830s, the decade of colonization, the Sultanate of Morocco did not have the territories of the Sahara. It did have them at its peak, but by the time Spain colonized the Sahara there was the Tekna confederation, which did not depend politically or religiously on Morocco.

2) It tries to feed back to the Almoravid and Almohad empires that came to have control over the Sahara, but these empires ended 800 years ago. That's a long time. Literally more time has passed since the fall of the Almohad empire than the entire history of Al-Andalus.

3) The ""Greater Morocco"" plan brings together all the territories that once belonged to those medieval dynasties as Moroccan territory. Does it remind you of anyone? (cough...cough...Israel...cough cough...)

4) Many Moroccans support the Palestinian cause, but the Moroccan government is pro-Israel. Isn't there a contradiction? It's literally the same phenomenon. A country claims a territory that belonged to it hundreds of years ago but at that time it didn't, and invades it without considering what the people there think.

5) Morocco in general of the Amazigh peoples who live there. Curiously, the Tekna Sahrawis are also an Amazigh people. Why did they have to exile themselves to Tindouf? Aren't they part of their own people?

6) If Morocco is truly the legitimate sovereign of the Sahara, why has it systematically refused to hold a referendum? Are they afraid of losing? Aren't the Sahrawis supposed to be part of their people, so why would they vote against Morocco?

Obviously all this happens because Morocco is based on an expansionist delusion with historical distortion. And even if we agreed with it, what is the point of invading a territory and starting a war with your supposedly own people? Expansionist delusions. There is no other explanation.

2) Recognation

SADR handle the direct interactions with Mauretania
And reversed, Mauretania interactions with morroco goes via SADR.

Who carried out constant aggression towards the Sahrawi people? It was Morocco before 21st century. In September 1991, the UN brokered a ceasefire and a simple deal: the 16 year old war would end, and within a year, the UN would organize a referendum to let the Sahrawi peoples decide their future. To make this happen, the UN created a mission called MINURSO. As the voter registry was being made, Morocco flooded Western Sahara with Moroccan settlers and demanded that they be allowed to vote (which cleary would influence the referendum greatly to their favor). This directly violated the Geneva Conventions: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population into the territory it occupies”. For more than 30 years, this referendum was not held.

Who carried out constant aggression towards the Sahrawi people? It was Morocco before 21st century. In September 1991, the UN brokered a ceasefire and a simple deal: the 16 year old war would end, and within a year, the UN would organize a referendum to let the Sahrawi peoples decide their future. To make this happen, the UN created a mission called MINURSO. As the voter registry was being made, Morocco flooded Western Sahara with Moroccan settlers and demanded that they be allowed to vote (which cleary would influence the referendum greatly to their favor). This directly violated the Geneva Conventions: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population into the territory it occupies”.

And just like Israel, they have a project called “the Grand Morocco”, they intend to extend the territory France helped them enlarge, up to mid Algeria, and are very vocal about it. 
Wester Sahara is very rich in phosphate (that is critical for agriculture and will be lacking in a couple of years). So the deal was: you help us colonizing this country, and you get an endless supply (similar to the Quincy agreement between USA and Saudi Arabia).
The European Court found illegal the commerce of Wstern Sahara’s resources on behalf of Morocco to the EU, but guess what: they can’t care less as they are protected by the west. 

Most of the people don’t know about this because the US, France, Israel… (govt, not people) are complicit, and therefore the UN can’t do anything about it. 

Indeed.m, Algeria pressured the Security Council lately to resolve this issue. But America and France proposed a resolution to postpone it, instead (for more background look for : Security Council Resolution to extend MINURSO’s mandate for another year).

*A fact to consider, for people in the comments struggling with some Moroccans: they are propagandized, and that in addition to the fact that 49% of Moroccans suffer from mental illness (according to a recent report easily found on internet), they were also found to be the most dishonest people in the world by to 2 British studies (one in 2016 and one in 2019).

To Moroccans: stop saying “We didn’t know😢”. It’s the first thing that comes out of your mouth whenever you meet with an Algerian as Algeria is on the side of Wester Sahara.

4SakRNO_SMY,Sahara conflict Morocco,UgxyOwiZ2HwbfrW7HLB4AaABAg,@DR_ndo,"Morocco's inconsistencies in claiming Western Sahara are very curious and funny:

1) By the 1830s, the decade of colonization, the Sultanate of Morocco did not have the territories of the Sahara. It did have them at its peak, but by the time Spain colonized the Sahara there was the Tekna confederation, which did not depend politically or religiously on Morocco.

2) It tries to feed back to the Almoravid and Almohad empires that came to have control over the Sahara, but these empires ended 800 years ago. That's a long time. Literally more time has passed since the fall of the Almohad empire than the entire history of Al-Andalus.

3) The ""Greater Morocco"" plan brings together all the territories that once belonged to those medieval dynasties as Moroccan territory. Does it remind you of anyone? (cough...cough...Israel...cough cough...)

4) Many Moroccans support the Palestinian cause, but the Moroccan government is pro-Israel. Isn't there a contradiction? It's literally the same phenomenon. A country claims a territory that belonged to it hundreds of years ago but at that time it didn't, and invades it without considering what the people there think.

5) Morocco in general of the Amazigh peoples who live there. Curiously, the Tekna Sahrawis are also an Amazigh people. Why did they have to exile themselves to Tindouf? Aren't they part of their own people?

6) If Morocco is truly the legitimate sovereign of the Sahara, why has it systematically refused to hold a referendum? Are they afraid of losing? Aren't the Sahrawis supposed to be part of their people, so why would they vote against Morocco?

Obviously all this happens because Morocco is based on an expansionist delusion with historical distortion. And even if we agreed with it, what is the point of invading a territory and starting a war with your supposedly own people? Expansionist delusions. There is no other explanation.

Morocco helped well with chasing the occupyers away from SADR,
now it is time to go home.

2) Recognation
The people have been recognized as an society with an own territory.

3) HIGH POLITIC ALERT
If morroco let SADR handle its own,
SADR handle the direct interactions with Mauretania
And reversed, Mauretania interactions with morroco goes via SADR.

4) Border Patrol
Morroco's border is extended to an maximum without any progress.
Instead they have at least an two sides diplomatic war that can escalate.

5) Oil and other resources
The oil or other resources that have been produced,
found or magically appears in the Western Sahara,
is income of the SADR.

6) Membership
The SADR have the right to be member of the Arab League

7) Mine fields
SADR, in this message represented by Caliph Alaeeddine The First, temporarily applying the convention of Ottawa regarding landmines. After results, SADR decides if they add the convention in their Society Management, the SADR.

Here’s a breakdown:  <br><br>### <b>*1. Pre-Colonial Algeria*</b>  <br>- Before French colonization, Algeria was part of various North African empires (Numidians, Romans, Ottomans).  <br>- From 1516–1830, it was an <b>*Ottoman regency*</b> (autonomous province) with local rulers (*deys*).  <br><br>### <b>*2. French Colonization (1830–1962)*</b>  <br>- France invaded Algiers in **1830**, gradually conquering the territory.  <br>- By 1848, Algeria was declared <b>*French soil*</b> (not a colony but an integral part of France).  <br>- France imposed its administrative, educational, and economic systems, **dismantling traditional Algerian structures**.  <br><br>### <b>*3. Impact on Modern Algeria*</b>  <br>- <b>*Borders**: France defined Algeria’s modern borders, including the disputed **southern territories*</b> (later used for nuclear tests).  <br>- **Language &amp; Culture**: French became dominant; Arabic/Berber identity was suppressed.  <br>- **Political System**: Post-independence Algeria inherited France’s **centralized governance model**.  <br><br>### <b>*4. Independence (1962)*</b>  <br>- After a brutal <b>*8-year war*</b> (1954–1962), Algeria gained independence via the **Évian Accords**.  <br>- The **FLN (National Liberation Front)**, which led the revolution, established a socialist republic, **rejecting France’s legacy but retaining its administrative framework**.  <br><br>### <b>*5. Did France &quot;Create&quot; Algeria?*</b>  <br>- **No**: Algeria existed as a distinct region before France.  <br>- <b>*But**: Modern Algeria’s **state institutions, borders, and even some political elites*</b> (like the FLN) emerged in reaction to French rule.  <br><br>### <b>*Key Controversies*</b>  <br>- **Pieds-Noirs**: Over 1 million European settlers fled Algeria in 1962, leaving economic scars.  <br>- **Harkis**: Algerian collaborators with France were massacred post-independence.  <br>- **Neo-Colonialism**: France retained influence (oil/gas interests, military ties) until the 2020s.  <br><br>### <b>*Conclusion*</b>  <br>France didn’t &quot;create&quot; Algeria but **reshaped it violently**, leaving a legacy that still affects Algeria’s politics, language, and relations with Morocco (e.g., Western Sahara conflict).",0,2025-08-11T01:02:06Z,Ugzm7UsMj2g-A7nmBEZ4AaABAg,wijdaxalgeria as a modern nationstate was not created by france but its current borders administrative systems and aspects of its political identity were heavily shaped by french colonial rule heres a breakdown brbr b precolonial algeriab br before french colonization algeria was part of various north african empires numidians romans ottomans br from it was an bottoman regencyb autonomous province with local rulers deys brbr b french colonization b br france invaded algiers in gradually conquering the territory br by algeria was declared bfrench soilb not a colony but an integral part of france br france imposed its administrative educational and economic systems dismantling traditional algerian structures brbr b impact on modern algeriab br bborders france defined algerias modern borders including the disputed southern territoriesb later used for nuclear tests br language amp culture french became dominant arabicberber identity was suppressed br political system postindependence algeria inherited frances centralized governance model brbr b independence b br after a brutal byear warb algeria gained independence via the vian accords br the fln national liberation front which led the revolution established a socialist republic rejecting frances legacy but retaining its administrative framework brbr b did france quotcreatequot algeriab br no algeria existed as a distinct region before france br bbut modern algerias state institutions borders and even some political elitesb like the fln emerged in reaction to french rule brbr bkey controversiesb br piedsnoirs over million european settlers fled algeria in leaving economic scars br harkis algerian collaborators with france were massacred postindependence br neocolonialism france retained influence oilgas interests military ties until the s brbr bconclusionb brfrance didnt quotcreatequot algeria but reshaped it violently leaving a legacy that still affects algerias politics language and relations with morocco eg western sahara conflict

Here’s why it matters:<br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*1. It Destroyed France’s Illusion of Imperial Power*</b>  <br>- France had considered Algeria <b>*part of its homeland*</b> (unlike other colonies), making the war a <b>*civil war*</b> as much as a colonial conflict.  <br>- The conflict exposed France’s **systematic use of torture**, mass internment camps, and collective punishment, shocking the world and fracturing French society.  <br>- It led to the <b>*collapse of the French Fourth Republic*</b> (1958) and brought **de Gaulle to power**, who eventually accepted Algerian independence despite fierce opposition (including assassination attempts by far-right militias).  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*2. It Redefined What &quot;Decolonization&quot; Could Look Like*</b>  <br>- Unlike peaceful transitions in British Africa, Algeria’s war proved that **violence was often the price of freedom**—inspiring armed struggles from **Palestine to South Africa**.  <br>- The FLN’s tactics (urban guerrilla warfare, international diplomacy) became a **playbook for liberation movements**.  <br>- It forced the UN to confront colonialism head-on, making Algeria a **symbol of the Global South’s rise**.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*3. It Created Modern Algeria—For Better or Worse*</b>  <br>- The war <b>*killed 300,000–1 million Algerians*</b> (6–20% of the population) and left deep scars.  <br>- The FLN’s victory established a <b>*one-party socialist state*</b> that still dominates Algeria today, stifling dissent under the banner of &quot;revolutionary legitimacy.&quot;  <br>- **Post-war Algeria became a Cold War battleground**, aligning with the USSR and hosting revolutionaries like Che Guevara.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*4. It Haunts France to This Day*</b>  <br>- The war split France: **Leftists supported Algerian independence**, while far-right militants (OAS) bombed Paris to stop it.  <br>- Over <b>*1 million French settlers (Pieds-Noirs)*</b> fled to France, forming a **vocal anti-Algerian lobby**.  <br>- France only admitted it was a &quot;war&quot; (not a &quot;police operation&quot;) in **1999**—and still refuses to fully apologize for torture or massacres.  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*5. It Shapes the Maghreb’s Geopolitics*</b>  <br>- Algeria’s support for the <b>*Polisario Front*</b> in Western Sahara is rooted in its own anti-colonial struggle—a direct challenge to Morocco.  <br>- The war poisoned <b>*Franco-Algerian relations*</b> for decades (e.g., visa disputes, gas deals, memory wars).  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*Why It Still Matters*</b>  <br>- **Colonial Apologies**: Macron has taken steps (admitting torture, opening archives), but Algeria demands reparations.  <br>- **Immigrant Identity**: France’s Algerian diaspora (the largest in Europe) grapples with **generational trauma**.  <br>- **Authoritarianism**: Algeria’s regime still uses the war to **silence critics**, claiming dissent &quot;betrays the martyrs.&quot;  <br><br>---<br><br>### <b>*Final Thought*</b>  <br>This wasn’t just a war—it was a **reckoning**.

Here’s the historical breakdown:<br><br>### <b>*1. Pre-Spanish Period (Before 1884)*</b><br>- Western Sahara was a <b>*sparsely populated desert region*</b> inhabited by <b>*nomadic Sahrawi tribes*</b> (such as the Reguibat, Oulad Delim, and Tekna).<br>- These tribes had **loose, shifting allegiances**—sometimes paying tribute to the Moroccan Sultan (based in cities like Marrakesh or Fez) or Mauritanian emirates, but often acting independently.<br>- <b>*No permanent Moroccan administration*</b> (taxation, courts, or military garrisons) existed in Western Sahara.<br><br>### <b>*2. Morocco’s Historical Claims*</b><br>- Morocco argues that some Sahrawi tribes <b>*pledged allegiance (bay&#39;ah)*</b> to Moroccan sultans in the 17th–19th centuries.<br>- However, these oaths were **symbolic and intermittent**, not proof of direct control. The Sahara remained **de facto autonomous**.<br><br>### <b>*3. Spain’s Colonization (1884)*</b><br>- At the **Berlin Conference (1884–85)**, Spain claimed Western Sahara as **&quot;Spanish Sahara&quot;**, with no Moroccan resistance.<br>- Morocco itself was <b>*weak and fragmented*</b> in the 19th century, struggling against European encroachment (France occupied Morocco in **1912**).<br><br>### <b>*4. International Court of Justice (ICJ) Ruling (1975)*</b><br>- The ICJ examined Morocco’s historical claims and <b>*rejected*</b> the argument of pre-colonial sovereignty:<br>  &gt; <b>&quot;The Court’s conclusion is that the materials and information presented to it do not establish any tie of territorial sovereignty between Western Sahara and the Moroccan Sultanate.&quot;</b>  <br>- Instead, the ICJ affirmed the **right of Sahrawis to self-determination**.<br><br>### <b>*5.

It was Morocco before 21st century. In September 1991, the UN brokered a ceasefire and a simple deal: the 16 year old war would end, and within a year, the UN would organize a referendum to let the Sahrawi peoples decide their future. To make this happen, the UN created a mission called MINURSO. As the voter registry was being made, Morocco flooded Western Sahara with Moroccan settlers and demanded that they be allowed to vote (which cleary would influence the referendum greatly to their favor). This directly violated the Geneva Conventions: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its civilian population into the territory it occupies”. For more than 30 years, this referendum was not held.

Tebboune is pouring billions of dollars into deals with the Polisario that aim to give Algeria access to ports in the Sahara to export iron from the Tindouf mines — territory that was originally Moroccan and lies very close to the Moroccan Sahara.

In 2024, Algeria signed a contract with Mauritania to finance a railway from Tindouf to the port of Nouakchott. The agreement allows Algeria to use Nouakchott’s port to export iron, with the contract renewable every 10 years. The railway stretches about 1,800 km, while the Moroccan port of Laayoune is only 400 km away. If the Polisario were to seize the Sahara, Algeria could use Laayoune freely and permanently — likely the true motive behind their support.

Yet Algeria appears to be losing faith in this scenario. It has begun constructing a railway from Tindouf to the Mediterranean to reduce dependence on Mauritania, which may one day refuse to renew the deal. Other African routes exist but are far too distant.

At this moment it seems like Spain and France are saying to us: 'we have nothing to do with this problem, fight about it with the algeriens and if you want us to support you at the UN than you must let us continue exploitating the country'. 

Paradoxically, the UN is helping France and Spain to escape from their historical involvement, responsibility and culpability in creating this disaster and points only to Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania and Polisario as those who should negotiate for a solution. Obviously a try of the Western World to avoid any kind of direct involvement and confrontation but at the same time they use and abuse this political problem to exploit and rob Morocco of its wealth. Not to mention the current unrest and division in North Africa. This proves that the UN is nothing but a tool of the West to continue their colonial ambitions, now on an economic level. 

While in deciding on the Sahara file, France and Spain must be overwhelmed present and decisive. Their involvement in making a decision possible is not only needed but even obligated. Because it's Spain and France who divided Morocco and therefore it's their responsibility to restore the stability and unity of the country again. 

In fact making Spain and France 'admit that they divided' Morocco is already a recognition of the Moroccan Sahara, that immediately 'must' be by the whole world.

Safi, home to one of OCP’s major fertilizer plants, is often shrouded in smog, and residents report health issues linked to exposure to industrial emissions. Workers in these facilities have reported respiratory problems and cancers, with some attributing their illnesses to long-term exposure to dust and gases from ammonia, fluoride, phosphoric, and sulphuric acid, despite minimal protective measures. The industry discharges large amounts of phosphogypsum—a radioactive waste byproduct—into the Atlantic Ocean near Safi and Jorf Lasfar.

That will not happen. Because, .... because the most of those countries don't care that much about us and above that they have no clue about our history.

Normally, the most sensible approach to solving the problem is to involve the countries that are essentially responsible for this. Ofcourse I am talking here about France and Spain. At this moment it seems like Spain and France are saying to us: 'we have nothing to do with this problem, fight about it with the algeriens and if you want us to support you at the UN than you must let us continue exploitating the country'. 

Paradoxically, the UN is helping France and Spain to escape from their historical involvement, responsibility and culpability in creating this disaster and points only to Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania and Polisario as those who should negotiate for a solution. Obviously a try of the Western World to avoid any kind of direct involvement and confrontation but at the same time they use and abuse this political problem to exploit and rob Morocco of its wealth. Not to mention the current unrest and division in North Africa. This proves that the UN is nothing but a tool of the West to continue their colonial ambitions, now on an economic level. 

While in deciding on the Sahara file, France and Spain must be overwhelmed present and decisive. Their involvement in making a decision possible is not only needed but even obligated. Because it's Spain and France who divided Morocco and therefore it's their responsibility to restore the stability and unity of the country again. 

In fact making Spain and France 'admit that they divided' Morocco is already a recognition of the Moroccan Sahara, that immediately 'must' be by the whole world.

They are being held by Algeria's puppet the Polisario in these poor living conditions. Morocco would welcome them back absolutely. This video is completely biased as it makes Spain, Algeria and  the Polisario look good. Spain is the criminal state that invaded our Sahara which historically belongs to us our kingdom/sultanate. The Spanish government alongside the Algerian regime are the enemies of Morocco, but we are strong and we will defend the integrity of out land. Spain did the same thing by betraying the U.S by allowing Hugo Carvajal a Venezuelan criminal escape. Spain is no stranger when it comes to betrayal. I have nothing against the Spanish people, but not for one minute I would consider their government as an ally. 

Morocco tries to cooperate with Spain and Algeria on numerous occasions. King Mohammed VI has urged the Algerian government for a dialogue to try and normalise relations and to work towards neutrality for the opening of the borders. Algeria's arrogant regime ignores this and this takes a toll on the Moroccan and Algerian populations who have family and friends who want to visit each other. Morocco as well constantly does Spain's dirty work by protecting Ceuta's and Melilia's borders even though those enclaves belong to Morocco and this is still a sign of colonialism in 2021. Morocco still puts up with that, but Spain refuses to cooperate and yet again this is the state that caused this problem in the first place by invading the Sahara and creating instability. Finally Spain has the Catalan and the Basque movements that they worry about, and Morocco always supported a modern Spanish state undivided, but Spain does the opposite to us.

Morocco was even bigger before colonization! We respect international law and have good relations with europe and the rest of the world. Polisario terrorist only now form a large isis group that only seek to murder and destroy. Even now in their camps they dont let sahrawis walk free and there is no form of any freedom and only slavery, extortion, torture and killing. Morocco will ensure that the sahara is and will stay Moroccan where everybody can enjoy! Sahrawis are welcome to their homeland morocco with full rights. 

We welcome the whole world to see transparantly what is happening and we work with the united nations and other neighbouring (unfriendly states lile algeria and mauritania) to try and solve it peacefully. Algeria is hostile behind the scenes and also the days of the polisario will be over if they continue provocations and hinder freedom of navigation in the guergerrat border area. 

We went in with the United Nations Army so they can monitor moroccos actions. What did the polisario do? Blocked the way entry for the UN staff personell to tindouf. You block international traffic and put up poor illegal roadchecks to terrorize traffic of west north africa and the rest of the world.

For hundreds of years Morocco claimed large portions of Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands, Algeria, Mauritania and Mali. But time continues to move on and Europe grew stronger.  By the  1880s the Europeans began their conquest of Africa and by 1912 France and Spain had conquered the continents last stronghold, The Islamic Kingdom of Morocco. Only The Coptic Christian Empire of Ethiopia and Democratic Republic of Liberia remained independent from European Colonialism. 

When the Kingdom of Morocco finally won its independence from France in 1956, they began a noble effort of ridding itself of the Spanish enclaves that still survived on its territory. But their attempts to restore its claims on other former European colonies that had become independent such as the Socialist Republic of Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Federated Republic of Mali were rebuffed. And so Morocco focused its claims on the weakest and least populous Spanish Colony of the Western Sahara and in 1975, over 300,000 Moroccans peacefully marched into the northern part of the territory demanding reunification.  Spain capitulated and agreed to partition their colony between Morocco and Mauritania instead of granting self determination to Africa’s last European Colony. 

The peoples of the Western Sahara considered this a betrayal and began a war of liberation. Inspired by the struggle of the Palestinians against Israeli occupation, the Sahrawis  formed their own PLO, known as POLISARIO in 1973 to fight for independence from not only Spain, but Morocco and Mauritania. Most had to flee in exile to Algeria, which agreed to support their rights of self determination and in 1976 they declared their independence. By 1978, they defeated the Mauritanians, who gave up their claims, but then Morocco annexed mostly all of the Western Sahara and built a Wall with land mines between their colony, which they annexed and the small area that had been liberated. 

Yet even though I believe that Morocco rights to reclaim its pre 1912 territories is a noble cause, so do I believe in the cause of self determination of the Western Sahara. And therefore just as I believe in a Two-State solution between Israel and Palestine, so should there be, after nearly 50 years, a two-state solution between Morocco and the peoples of the Western Sahara.",0,2025-03-14T06:57:35Z,,i love morocco but i dont love their denial of self determination to the peoples of the western sahara africas last colony for hundreds of years morocco claimed large portions of spain portugal the canary islands algeria mauritania and mali but time continues to move on and europe grew stronger by the s the europeans began their conquest of africa and by france and spain had conquered the continents last stronghold the islamic kingdom of morocco only the coptic christian empire of ethiopia and democratic republic of liberia remained independent from european colonialism when the kingdom of morocco finally won its independence from france in they began a noble effort of ridding itself of the spanish enclaves that still survived on its territory but their attempts to restore its claims on other former european colonies that had become independent such as the socialist republic of algeria the islamic republic of mauritania and the federated republic of mali were rebuffed and so morocco focused its claims on the weakest and least populous spanish colony of the western sahara and in over moroccans peacefully marched into the northern part of the territory demanding reunification spain capitulated and agreed to partition their colony between morocco and mauritania instead of granting self determination to africas last european colony the peoples of the western sahara considered this a betrayal and began a war of liberation inspired by the struggle of the palestinians against israeli occupation the sahrawis formed their own plo known as polisario in to fight for independence from not only spain but morocco and mauritania most had to flee in exile to algeria which agreed to support their rights of self determination and in they declared their independence by they defeated the mauritanians who gave up their claims but then morocco annexed mostly all of the western sahara and built a wall with land mines between their colony which they annexed and the small area that had been liberated yet even though i believe that morocco rights to reclaim its pre territories is a noble cause so do i believe in the cause of self determination of the western sahara and therefore just as i believe in a twostate solution between israel and palestine so should there be after nearly years a twostate solution between morocco and the peoples of the western sahara

In 1991, the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army ""Polisario"" and Morocco agreed to a ceasefire and organize a referendum that would allow the Sahrawi people to determine their fate, but the referendum was never organized due to Morocco's obstruction, until the autonomy plan was proposed in 2007 and it was said that it was the only realistic solution and that it would not accept anything else. The issue is still in the United Nations until now and is classified as decolonization.
